# Location Selection Guidelines:
selection_criteria:
  isolation_level:
    extreme: "No nearby help, communication difficult/impossible"
    very_high: "Help far away, limited communication"
    high: "Isolated but communication possible"
    medium: "Some isolation, help available but delayed"
    low: "Urban/populated, help theoretically available"

  temporal_liminality:
    very_high: "Exists outside normal time flow, eternal/frozen quality"
    high: "Strong sense of time suspension or alteration"
    medium: "Notable temporal dissonance"
    low: "Normal time experience"

  infrastructure:
    none: "Natural environment, no human systems"
    minimal: "Basic shelter/utilities only"
    basic: "Essential facilities, limited complexity"
    moderate: "Full facilities, some specialization"
    complex: "Specialized systems, hierarchical access"
    specialized: "Unique/technical infrastructure"

# Usage Notes:
usage_notes:
  - "Match location isolation to entry condition (extreme isolation needs strong entry pressure)"
  - "Consider infrastructure level when designing rule discovery (complex infrastructure = more rules)"
  - "Temporal liminality affects rule type (high liminality supports time-based rules)"
  - "Natural rhythms provide ready-made rule frameworks"
  - "Typical roles suggest narrator positions and rule relationships"

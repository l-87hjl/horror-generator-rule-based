# Constraints:
constraints:
  - "Incompleteness must serve narrative purpose, not create arbitrary difficulty"
  - "Narrator's ability to discover/understand should match their entry condition"
  - "Whatever is incomplete, the rules themselves must remain invariant"
  - "Reader should be able to track what narrator knows vs doesn't know"

# Anti-patterns:
anti_patterns:
  - "Incompleteness used to hide author's lack of planning"
  - "Rules change rather than narrator's understanding evolving"
  - "Missing information impossible to discover or infer"
  - "Narrator ignores obvious patterns without reason"

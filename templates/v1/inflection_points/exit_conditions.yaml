# CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
constraints:
  - "Exit type must be established or strongly hinted early"
  - "Cannot change exit type arbitrarily (false exit must be planned)"
  - "Exit should resolve thematically, not just plotwise"
  - "Narrator's arc should connect to exit type"
  - "Exit must respect rule invariance (cannot break system logic)"

# Resolution Discipline:
resolution_principles:
  - "Ending must resolve through cost/transformation, not convenience"
  - "No deus ex machina or arbitrary solutions"
  - "Something must be permanently lost or changed"
  - "System should end because it resolves, not because story stops"
  - "Exit (or lack thereof) should feel inevitable from setup"

# Anti-patterns:
anti_patterns:
  - "Narrator escapes easily despite story suggesting impossibility"
  - "Exit appears with no prior setup or earning"
  - "Cost promised but not actually paid"
  - "Ambiguous ending that's actually unclear plotting"
  - "Happy ending that doesn't acknowledge what was sacrificed"
  - "Narrator unchanged by experience"
  - "Escape hatch that violates established rules"

# Thematic Exit Alignment:
thematic_guidance:
  grief_avoidance: "Exit often impossible or requires facing what was avoided"
  complicity: "Exit requires acknowledging/accepting complicity"
  contamination: "Exit carries contamination out or requires staying contained"
  forgotten_obligation: "Exit through completing or breaking inherited duty"
  punishment: "Exit is survival with scarring"
  transformation: "Exit is becoming something else"

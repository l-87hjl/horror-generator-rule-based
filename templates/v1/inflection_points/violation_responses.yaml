response_models:
  contamination:
    description: "Violation spreads corruption/change to narrator or environment"
    characteristics:
      - "Violation leaves permanent mark"
      - "Contamination persists and may spread"
      - "Multiple violations compound contamination"
    mechanical_progression:
      - "First violation: Initial contamination (subtle)"
      - "Subsequent violations: Spread or intensification"
      - "Late stage: Contamination overtakes normalcy"
    narrative_effects:
      - "Body horror or environmental decay"
      - "Narrator becomes increasingly othered"
      - "Sense of irreversible change"
    implementation_requirements:
      - "Contamination must be trackable (physical marks, behavioral changes, etc.)"
      - "Should follow logical progression pattern"
      - "Cannot be washed away or undone easily"
      - "Late-stage contamination should affect narrator's capabilities/choices"
    example_manifestations:
      - "Physical transformation (rot, marks, changes)"
      - "Perceptual contamination (seeing differently)"
      - "Behavioral contamination (compulsions, limitations)"
      - "Environmental spread (location changing)"
    escalation_pattern:
      - "Violation 1: Localized mark/change"
      - "Violation 2-3: Spreading to new areas/faculties"
      - "Violation 4+: Systemic transformation"
    best_for_themes:
      - "Becoming the monster"
      - "Corruption"
      - "Loss of humanity/normalcy"

  reclassification:
    description: "Violation changes narrator's category/status in the system"
    characteristics:
      - "Narrator moves from protected to vulnerable category"
      - "Status change alters how rules apply"
      - "System now treats narrator differently"
    mechanical_progression:
      - "Initial status: Observer/protected/employee/guest"
      - "After violation: Intruder/prey/participant/bound"
      - "New status comes with new rules or lack of protections"
    narrative_effects:
      - "Crossing threshold from safety to danger"
      - "Recognition that protection is lost"
      - "System's regard for narrator changes"
    implementation_requirements:
      - "Initial status must be established clearly"
      - "Violation that triggers reclassification must be significant"
      - "New status must come with observable differences"
      - "Cannot be undone through simple reversal"
    example_manifestations:
      - "Guest becomes trespasser (no longer owed hospitality)"
      - "Employee becomes intruder (facility turns hostile)"
      - "Observer becomes participant (now subject to rules)"

    escalation_pattern:

# CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
constraints:
  - "NEVER allow state reset after violation (no 'undo' button)"
  - "NEVER restore normalcy without permanent cost"
  - "Violations must worsen, transform, or contaminate—never simply reverse"
  - "Consequences must follow logically from violation type"
  - "Narrator's relationship to system must change, not just reset"
  - "Multiple violations must compound, not replace previous consequences"

# FORBIDDEN RESPONSES:
forbidden_responses:
  - "Violation happens, then reality resets to pre-violation state"
  - "Consequence occurs but then disappears/heals completely"
  - "Narrator violates rule but nothing actually changes"
  - "Major violation has same consequence as minor one"
  - "Consequences that feel random rather than systematically related to violation"
  - "Ability to 'game' the system through exploitation"

# Anti-patterns (The "Ticket Problem" and similar):
anti_patterns:
  - "Narrator violates rule, consequence happens, narrator does arbitrary action, consequence undone"
  - "Objects or actions that negate consequences without being established as having that power"
  - "System that punishes then forgives without narrative cost"
  - "Violations that matter initially but stop mattering later"
  - "Escape hatches that allow narrator to avoid permanent change"

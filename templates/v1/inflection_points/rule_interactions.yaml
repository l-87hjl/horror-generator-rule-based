interaction_types:
  dependency:
    description: "One rule requires another to be followed first"
    characteristics:
      - "Sequential or prerequisite relationships"
      - "Later rules build on earlier compliance"
      - "Violation of prerequisite invalidates dependent rule"
    mechanical_logic:
      - "Rule A must be completed before Rule B applies"
      - "Rule B only protects if Rule A was followed"
      - "Chain of compliance creates cumulative safety/binding"
    narrative_effects:
      - "Creates procedural complexity"
      - "Missed steps have cascading consequences"
      - "Requires narrator to track sequence"
    implementation_notes:
      - "Dependency must be stated or discoverable"
      - "Consequences of broken dependency must be logical"
      - "Should not create impossible situations"
    example_structures:
      - "Must complete ritual A before entering area B"
      - "Protection only works if previous rule followed"
      - "Each step unlocks next requirement"

      - "Procedural horror"
      - "Ritual integrity"
      - "Cascading failure"

  threshold:
    description: "Rules activate or change based on quantity/frequency"

      - "Narrator must navigate apparent impossibility"
      - "Resolution reveals hidden compatibility or forces choice"
    mechanical_logic:
      - "Rule A says do X, Rule B says don't do X"

      - "Narrator must adapt without changing rule"
    mechanical_logic:
      - "Rule says 'do X when Y' but Y's definition shifts"

# Constraints for rule interactions:
constraints:
  - "Interactions must not violate individual rule invariance"
  - "Complexity should emerge from interaction, not individual rule changes"
  - "Narrator must be able to track and understand interactions"
  - "Should create strategic depth without arbitrary impossibility"
  - "Multiple interaction types can combine but must remain coherent"

# Anti-patterns:
anti_patterns:
  - "Rules that change based on interactions (vs. application/effect changing)"
  - "Interactions that create unsolvable paradoxes without narrative purpose"
  - "Complexity that obscures rather than deepens engagement"
  - "Arbitrary interactions with no logical basis"
  - "Narrator unable to discover interaction patterns"

# Constraints for rule discovery:
constraints:
  - "Discovery method must match entry condition logically"
  - "Rules discovered must remain invariant once established"
  - "Narrator's knowledge can grow but rules cannot change"
  - "Discovery should create engagement, not confusion"
  - "Method should support narrative tension, not delay it arbitrarily"

# Anti-patterns to avoid:
anti_patterns:
  - "Rules change after discovery (unless that's the horror)"
  - "Information withheld to create false mystery"
  - "Narrator ignores clear evidence without reason"
  - "Discovery method incompatible with setting"
  - "Rules too obscure to be discovered reasonably"

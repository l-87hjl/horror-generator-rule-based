# Thematic Constraints:
constraints:
  - "Theme must be enacted through rule system, not just described"
  - "Rules should force engagement with thematic tension"
  - "Violation responses should reflect thematic core"
  - "Resolution must address theme, not just plot"
  - "Theme should be statable in one sentence but complex in execution"

# Anti-patterns:
anti_patterns:
  - "Theme mentioned but not structurally integrated"
  - "Rules unrelated to thematic tension"
  - "Resolution ignores thematic implications"
  - "Theme changes partway through"
  - "Multiple competing themes without integration"

# Theme Selection Guidance:
selection_guidance:
  single_theme: "Focus intensifies horror; every element reinforces"
  dual_themes: "Choose complementary themes that intersect (grief + obligation)"
  avoid: "More than two primary themes dilutes effectiveness"

# Thematic Payoff Requirements:
payoff_requirements:
  - "Ending must enact thematic choice (not just describe it)"
  - "Narrator's fate should reflect thematic position"
  - "Reader should be able to state theme from story structure alone"
  - "Theme should feel inevitable from rule system design"

The gas station squatted against the desert highway like a tumor under the fluorescent wash of its own sickly lighting. I pulled my Honda into the cracked asphalt lot at 11:47 PM, according to the dashboard clock that had been running three minutes slow for the past two years. The Sinclair sign buzzed overhead, its green dinosaur logo flickering intermittently, casting strange shadows that seemed to move independently of the light source.

I'd been driving for fourteen hours straight, fueled by gas station coffee and the kind of desperate energy that comes from having nowhere else to go. The job posting had been sparse on details: "Overnight clerk needed. Must be reliable. Must follow instructions exactly." The pay was decent enough, and the manager—a gravelly-voiced man named Earl—had hired me over the phone after a five-minute conversation. No background check, no references required. Just show up ready to work.

The automatic doors wheezed open as I approached, releasing a gust of air that carried the familiar cocktail of cigarettes, energy drinks, and something else I couldn't identify—something organic and slightly sweet, like fruit left too long in the sun. The interior was standard convenience store fare: rows of snacks and beverages, a hot food station that looked like it hadn't been cleaned since the Clinton administration, and a lottery ticket display behind the register.

But something felt wrong about the proportions. The aisles seemed to stretch back farther than they should, given what I'd seen of the building's exterior. The ceiling tiles were water-stained in patterns that almost looked deliberate, like someone had arranged the leaks to form shapes I couldn't quite recognize.

"You must be the new guy." The voice came from behind the counter, though I hadn't seen anyone there moments before. A thin man in his fifties emerged from a doorway marked 'EMPLOYEES ONLY,' his name tag reading 'Gary' in faded letters. His skin had the pallor of someone who hadn't seen sunlight in years, and his eyes held the thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran or a long-term night shift worker.

"Yeah, I'm Jake. Earl said to ask for Gary."

He nodded, pulling out a worn manila folder from beneath the register. "Training materials. Most important thing is this list here." He extracted a single sheet of paper, the kind that had been photocopied so many times the text was starting to blur. "Rules. You follow these exactly, no exceptions, no questions. Do that, and you'll be fine."

I took the paper, scanning the seven numbered items. They seemed oddly specific, the kind of arbitrary regulations that develop in any workplace over time. Though some of them struck me as unusual.

"Form 77-B?" I asked, pointing to rule five.

Gary reached under the counter again, producing a stack of triplicate forms. "Keep these handy. You'll know when you need them." His expression suggested I shouldn't ask for clarification.

"What about the security cameras?" I glanced around, noting the black domes mounted in each corner of the store.

"Monitor's behind the counter. Check it every fifteen minutes or so. Sometimes..." He paused, seeming to choose his words carefully. "Sometimes the cameras see things differently than we do. When that happens, you follow rule two exactly. Count to thirteen, no more, no less."

The fluorescent lights above us hummed with an irregular rhythm, occasionally dimming and brightening as if the building were breathing. Gary noticed my upward glance.

"Electrical system's old. Building's been here since 1987. Sometimes the lights get a mind of their own, especially during the dead hours. That's why we have rule six."

He walked me through the basic operations: register codes, cigarette inventory, coffee machine maintenance. Standard stuff, though he kept returning to the importance of following the rules. "Previous guy didn't take them seriously," he said while showing me how to work the lottery machine. "Had to let him go."

"What happened?"

Gary's hands stilled on the machine's keypad. "He started thinking he knew better. Started making exceptions. That's not how this place works."

At 11:55, Gary gathered his things—a thermos, a paperback novel with a cracked spine, and a small wooden cross that he tucked carefully into his shirt pocket. "Your shift officially starts at midnight. I'll be back at six AM. Remember—follow the rules exactly, and everything will be fine."

He paused at the door, looking back at me with something that might have been sympathy. "And Jake? Don't overthink things. Sometimes the night shift gets to people, makes them see patterns that aren't there, hear things that don't make sense. Just stick to the rules, and you'll be okay."

The automatic doors wheezed shut behind him, leaving me alone in the fluorescent wasteland.

I spent the first few minutes familiarizing myself with the layout. The store was larger than it appeared from outside, with six aisles of merchandise stretching back toward a wall lined with refrigerated cases. A walk-in cooler door stood slightly ajar in the back corner, its interior dark. The employee break room was located behind the counter, its door secured with a deadbolt that looked newer than the rest of the hardware.

At exactly midnight, the first customer arrived—a trucker who bought coffee, a sandwich, and a pack of Marlboros. The transaction went smoothly until I tried to give him change for his twenty.

"Sorry," I said, remembering rule three just in time. "After midnight, I need exact change only."

He grumbled but dug through his pockets, eventually producing the correct amount. As he left, I noticed his reflection in the door's glass seemed to linger for a moment after he'd passed through.

The security monitor showed four different camera angles: the front entrance, the sales floor, the back storage area, and the parking lot. Everything looked normal, matching what I could see with my own eyes. I made a mental note to check it every fifteen minutes, as Gary had instructed.

The next hour passed quietly. A few more customers trickled in—late-night commuters, insomniacs buying energy drinks, a woman who spent twenty minutes selecting lottery tickets with the intensity of someone defusing a bomb. All routine transactions, all completed without incident.

At 1:17, I heard my first voice from the cooler.

It was faint, barely audible over the hum of the refrigeration units, but unmistakably my own voice calling out. "Hello? Can someone help me back here?" The words were muffled, as if spoken from a great distance, but the inflection was exactly right—the slight upturn at the end of questions that I'd inherited from my mother's side of the family.

I stood frozen behind the counter, rule four echoing in my mind. Do not enter the walk-in cooler if you can hear your own voice calling from inside. The voice came again, more insistent this time. "I think I'm locked in. The door won't open."

My hand had actually moved toward the counter's edge, my body preparing to investigate, when I forced myself to stop. The rules were clear. I turned up the radio instead, letting classic rock drown out whatever was calling from the cooler.

At 2:15, I checked the security monitor and felt my stomach drop. The camera showing the sales floor displayed a completely different layout than what I was seeing. Instead of six aisles running perpendicular to the front counter, the monitor showed a maze-like arrangement of shelving units, creating narrow pathways that twisted and turned in impossible configurations. A figure moved through the maze—tall, wearing what looked like a convenience store uniform, but walking with a jerky, unnatural gait.

I closed my eyes and began counting. One. Two. Three. The fluorescent lights seemed brighter against my closed eyelids. Seven. Eight. Nine. I could hear the soft whisper of the ventilation system, the distant hum of traffic on the highway. Twelve. Thirteen.

When I opened my eyes, the monitor showed the correct layout again. The sales floor matched reality, empty except for the familiar rows of merchandise. But I could swear I smelled something different now—that same organic sweetness I'd noticed when I first entered, but stronger, more cloying.

A customer entered at 2:31, a middle-aged man in a business suit that had seen better days. He browsed the aisles for several minutes before approaching the counter with empty hands.

"I'd like to buy some cigarettes," he said.

"What brand?"

"The ones from aisle four, third shelf down, behind the motor oil."

I glanced toward aisle four, which contained automotive supplies, candy, and household items. No cigarettes. "I'm sorry, but we don't have cigarettes in that location. They're all behind the counter here."

His expression didn't change. "I need the cigarettes from aisle four, third shelf down, behind the motor oil."

Rule five. I reached under the counter for the stack of triplicate forms. "You'll need to fill out Form 77-B for that request."

He stared at me for a long moment, his eyes reflecting the fluorescent light like a nocturnal animal's. Then, without a word, he turned and walked back into the store. I watched him disappear around the corner of aisle two, but when I checked the security monitor, he was nowhere to be seen.

The break room door rattled at 2:47.

It started as a gentle testing of the handle, the kind of sound someone makes when they're checking if a door is locked. Then came three soft knocks, followed by a voice I didn't recognize.

"Excuse me? I think I left my keys in there earlier."

The knocking grew more insistent. "Hello? I know someone's out there. I can see the lights."

I remained at the counter, rule seven burned into my memory. The employee break room door must remain locked between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM, regardless of who or what requests entry. The knocking continued for another ten minutes before finally stopping, leaving behind a silence that felt heavier than the noise had been.

At 3:15, the lights began their dance.

It started with the fluorescent fixture above the front door, flickering once, twice, then going dark for a full three seconds before blazing back to life. Then the next light in sequence, moving toward the back of the store like a slow wave. I watched the pattern progress: front door, register area, aisle one, aisle two, continuing inexorably toward the rear wall.

Rule six. I had to walk the pattern in reverse.

I moved quickly to the back of the store, then began walking forward, timing my steps to match the flickering lights in reverse order. Back wall, aisle six, aisle five, four, three, two, one, register, front door. As I reached the entrance, the lights stabilized, returning to their normal harsh fluorescent glow.

My hands were shaking as I returned to the counter. The clock showed 3:32 AM, and I found myself watching the entrance with a mixture of anticipation and dread. One minute until the most specific rule of all would take effect.

At 3:33 exactly, someone walked through the automatic doors.

She looked normal enough—a woman in her thirties, wearing jeans and a faded t-shirt, her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail. But there was something wrong with the way she moved, as if she were walking underwater or through thick syrup. Her footsteps made no sound on the linoleum floor.

She approached the counter directly, her eyes meeting mine. "Excuse me," she said, her voice carrying an odd echo, as if spoken in a large empty room. "Could you tell me what time it is?"

Rule one blazed in my mind: Never acknowledge or respond to any patron who enters after 3:33 AM until they have made a purchase. I forced myself to look away, focusing on the magazine rack beside the register as if she weren't there at all.

"Hello?" she said, leaning closer. "I know you can hear me."

I busied myself with unnecessary tasks—straightening the lottery tickets, wiping down the already-clean counter, checking the coffee levels. The woman stood there for what felt like hours, occasionally speaking, sometimes just breathing in that hollow, echoing way.

Finally, she moved away from the counter, disappearing into the aisles. I tracked her movement on the security monitor, watching as she selected a single item—a candy bar from the rack near the cooler. She returned to the counter and placed it down with a soft thud.

"That'll be $1.50," I said, my voice hoarse from the long silence.

She smiled, and I noticed her teeth were too white, too uniform, like a dental advertisement. "Thank you for waiting," she said, handing me exact change. "Most people aren't very good at following rules."

As she left, I realized I'd been holding my breath. The automatic doors closed behind her with their familiar wheeze, and I was alone again with the humming lights and the smell of artificial fruit growing stronger by the hour.

The clock on the wall showed 4:17 AM. Less than two hours until Gary returned, until I could escape this fluorescent purgatory and pretend that nothing unusual had happened. But deep down, I knew this was only the beginning. The rules weren't arbitrary workplace regulations—they were a survival guide for something much worse.

And I was starting to understand that breaking them wasn't just grounds for termination.

It was something far more permanent.

---

The clock on the register read 2:47 AM when I noticed the security monitor had gone black. Not off—black, like someone had painted the screen with tar. I tapped it twice, and the image flickered back to life, showing the familiar layout of aisles and coolers. Everything looked normal, which somehow made it worse.

I'd been working at the Crossroads Gas & Go for exactly four hours, and I was already questioning every life choice that had led me here. The previous employee, Marcus, had quit without notice, leaving behind only a hastily scrawled note with seven rules that seemed like the paranoid ramblings of someone who'd spent too many nights alone with energy drinks and conspiracy theories. But after what I'd already experienced tonight, those rules were starting to feel less like paranoia and more like a survival manual.

The sweet, organic smell that had been lingering since midnight was getting stronger. It reminded me of overripe fruit mixed with something medicinal, like the way hospitals try to mask the scent of sickness. I'd checked the produce section twice—what little we had was fresh enough—but the smell seemed to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at once.

A soft thud came from the direction of the walk-in cooler, followed by what sounded distinctly like my own voice calling out, "Hey, can someone help me in here? I think the door's stuck."

Rule 4. Do not enter the walk-in cooler if you can hear your own voice calling from inside.

I gripped the edge of the counter and forced myself to look straight ahead at the empty store. The voice came again, more urgent this time: "Please, I've been trapped in here for hours. The handle won't turn from the inside."

It was perfect. Every inflection, every slight rasp I got when I was tired—it was exactly how I sounded. But I was standing behind the register, and I sure as hell wasn't in the cooler.

"I'm getting really cold in here," my voice pleaded from behind the heavy metal door. "Just open it for a second, please."

I turned up the radio to drown it out, but the static-filled classic rock couldn't quite mask the sound of something moving around in the cooler, bumping against the walls with increasing desperation. Whatever was in there was learning, adapting, trying different approaches to get me to break the rule.

The fluorescent lights above the candy aisle flickered once, then went steady. I held my breath, waiting, but they remained stable. Just old wiring, I told myself, though I kept Rule 6 ready in my mind: if they flickered in sequence from front to back, I had to walk the pattern in reverse.

At 2:58 AM, I noticed the security monitor again. The image showed our store, but the aisles were arranged differently. Where the chip rack should have been, there was a towering display of canned goods. The cooler section appeared to extend much deeper than it actually did, disappearing into shadows that shouldn't exist. I could see myself on the monitor, standing behind the counter, but the me on screen was facing the wrong direction, looking toward the back of the store with an expression I couldn't quite make out.

Rule 2. If the security cameras show a different layout of the store than what you can see, close your eyes and count to thirteen before looking again.

I squeezed my eyes shut and began counting. One. Two. Three. The voice from the cooler had stopped, but I could hear something else now—a soft scratching sound, like fingernails on metal. Four. Five. Six. The scratching grew more frantic. Seven. Eight. Nine. A new sound joined it: the squeak of shopping cart wheels moving slowly through the aisles. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. The cart wheels stopped directly in front of the counter. Thirteen.

I opened my eyes. The monitor showed the correct layout again, and I was facing the right direction on screen. But there was a shopping cart in front of the counter now, filled with items I'd never seen before: packages with labels in languages that didn't look quite right, cans with pictures of things that might have been food, bottles filled with liquids that seemed to move on their own.

The person pushing the cart was tall and thin, wearing a coat that was either very dark blue or black—it was hard to tell under the fluorescent lights. Their face was obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat, but I could see their hands clearly. The fingers were too long, with too many joints, and they moved with an unsettling fluid grace as they placed items on the counter.

"I'd like to purchase these," they said in a voice like rustling leaves.

I looked down at the items. None of them had price tags. None of them had barcodes. In fact, I was becoming increasingly certain that none of them were things that should exist in our reality, let alone be sold in a gas station convenience store.

Rule 5. Any customer who attempts to purchase items that are not on the shelves must be directed to fill out Form 77-B in triplicate.

"I'm sorry," I said, surprised by how steady my voice sounded. "These items aren't in our inventory. You'll need to fill out Form 77-B in triplicate."

I reached under the counter where Marcus had told me the forms would be, half-expecting to find nothing. But there they were: a stack of yellow forms with "77-B" printed at the top in faded blue ink. The form itself was bizarre—questions like "Describe the dimensional origin of requested merchandise" and "List any temporal displacement factors"—but I handed three copies to the customer without comment.

The impossible person took the forms with those too-long fingers and began filling them out with a pen that wrote in what looked like liquid silver. As they worked, I noticed that the shadows under their hat seemed to move independently of their head, and occasionally I caught glimpses of what might have been eyes—too many of them, arranged in patterns that made my vision blur.

At exactly 3:00 AM, something began rattling the handle of the employee break room door. The rattling was followed by knocking—polite at first, then increasingly insistent.

"Hello?" called a voice that sounded like my manager, Dave. "I left some important papers in there. Can you unlock the door?"

Rule 7. The employee break room door must remain locked between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM, regardless of who or what requests entry.

"Sorry, Dave," I called back, not taking my eyes off the impossible customer who was still filling out forms. "I can't unlock it until four."

"What? That's ridiculous. I'm the manager. Just open the damn door."

The voice was getting angry now, taking on an edge that didn't sound quite like Dave anymore. The knocking became pounding, and I could hear the door frame creaking under the assault.

"I said OPEN THE DOOR!" The voice had changed completely now, becoming something that hurt to listen to, like feedback from a broken speaker mixed with the sound of grinding metal.

The impossible customer looked up from their forms, and for a brief moment, I saw what was under that hat. I immediately wished I hadn't. My brain tried to process the arrangement of features that shouldn't exist, the geometry that didn't follow the rules of human anatomy, and I felt something fundamental inside my mind start to bend.

"Fascinating," the customer said, noticing my expression. "You're adapting well to the environment. Most don't last this long."

"What do you mean?" I asked, though part of me didn't want to know the answer.

"This place exists in the spaces between spaces," they explained, continuing to write with their silver pen. "A nexus point where different realities bleed through. The rules aren't arbitrary—they're the only thing keeping you anchored to your original dimension. Break them, and you slip into something else entirely."

The pounding on the break room door was getting louder, and I could hear the wood starting to splinter. Whatever was in there really wanted out, and it was getting stronger.

"How long has this place been like this?" I asked.

"Time moves differently here. Could be days, could be decades. The previous employee—Marcus, was it?—he lasted longer than most. But eventually, they all break a rule. They all slip through."

The customer finished the forms and slid them across the counter. The silver writing seemed to shimmer and move on the page, and I had to focus to keep the words from rearranging themselves as I watched.

"Will these be processed?" they asked.

I had no idea what processing Form 77-B actually meant, but I nodded and filed the papers in a slot behind the register that I was certain hadn't been there when I started my shift.

"Excellent." The impossible customer began gathering their strange merchandise back into the cart. "I'll return for them next week. Or perhaps last month. The temporal flow here is quite flexible."

As they turned to leave, the fluorescent lights above the front entrance began to flicker. Then the ones above the first aisle. Then the second aisle. The pattern was moving from front to back, exactly as Rule 6 described.

Rule 6. If the fluorescent lights begin flickering in sequence from front to back, you must walk the pattern in reverse until they stop.

I came out from behind the counter and began walking quickly toward the back of the store, then turned and walked to the front, following the reverse pattern of the flickering lights. As I moved, I could feel something following me—not the impossible customer, who had vanished along with their cart, but something else. Something that matched my footsteps exactly, always staying just outside my peripheral vision.

The lights stopped flickering when I reached the front of the store again, but the feeling of being followed remained. I hurried back to the counter, my heart pounding, and checked the clock.

3:33 AM.

The front door chimed, and someone walked in.

---

The figure that entered at 3:33 AM stood just inside the doorway, perfectly still. In the harsh fluorescent light, I could see it was wearing what looked like a gas station uniform identical to mine, down to the name tag. Even from behind the counter, I could make out the stitched letters: ALEX.

My name.

Rule 1 echoed in my mind: Never acknowledge or respond to any patron who enters after 3:33 AM until they have made a purchase. The thing wearing my face hadn't moved toward any of the shelves. It just stood there, watching me with eyes that reflected the overhead lights like mirrors.

"Hey," it said, and the voice was mine too. "Hey, can you help me find something?"

I gripped the edge of the counter and stared straight ahead at the wall behind it, focusing on a faded poster advertising energy drinks. Don't acknowledge. Don't respond. It hasn't made a purchase.

"I know you can hear me," my voice continued from the doorway. "I can see you're trying not to look. That's smart. You're learning."

The security monitors flickered in my peripheral vision. On screen three, I caught a glimpse of the store layout, but something was wrong. The aisles were running perpendicular to how they actually were, and there was a door in the back wall where the walk-in cooler should be. I squeezed my eyes shut and started counting.

One. Two. Three.

"You can close your eyes," the thing said, and I heard footsteps moving deeper into the store. "But I'll still be here when you open them."

Four. Five. Six.

The footsteps stopped. Then I heard the sound of items being moved around on shelves, packages rustling.

Seven. Eight. Nine.

"Found what I was looking for," my voice called out cheerfully.

Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen.

I opened my eyes. The monitors showed the correct layout now, aisles running the right direction, cooler in its proper place. But the thing wearing my face was approaching the counter, carrying a single item I couldn't quite make out.

It set the item on the counter between us. A name tag. Blank.

"I'd like to purchase this, please," it said with my voice, my inflection, even the slight nervous tremor I got when talking to strangers.

I looked down at the name tag. No price sticker. I glanced at the shelves visible from the counter – we didn't sell name tags. We didn't sell any kind of clothing or accessories.

Rule 5: Any customer who attempts to purchase items that are not on the shelves must be directed to fill out Form 77-B in triplicate.

"You'll need to fill out Form 77-B," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "In triplicate."

The thing smiled with my face, but the expression was wrong, too wide, lasting too long. "Of course. Where would I find that form?"

I turned toward the register, and as I did, a narrow slot appeared in the wall behind it, just like before. I reached in and pulled out three sheets of carbon paper forms labeled 77-B. The paper felt old, brittle, like it might crumble at a touch.

"Thank you," it said, taking the forms. Its fingers brushed mine, and they were ice cold. "I'll just fill these out right here."

It moved to the small counter by the window where people usually added cream to their coffee. I watched it write, using a pen that seemed to appear from nowhere. The scratching of the pen tip against paper was the only sound in the store, unnaturally loud.

While it wrote, I checked the security monitors again. Everything looked normal, but I noticed something that made my stomach drop. On the timestamp in the corner of each screen, the minutes were counting backward. 3:31 AM. 3:30 AM. 3:29 AM.

The thing finished writing and returned to the counter. It slid the forms across to me, and I could see they were filled out completely, though the handwriting wasn't mine. Under "Name" it had written: ALEX MORRISON. Under "Item Requested" it had written: IDENTITY. Under "Reason for Request" it had written: REPLACEMENT NEEDED.

"Everything appears to be in order," it said.

I took the forms with shaking hands and fed them into the slot behind the register. They disappeared with a soft whisking sound, like paper being sucked into a vacuum.

"How much for the name tag?" I asked.

"No charge," it replied. "This one's on the house."

It picked up the blank name tag and pinned it to its uniform, right over the one that said ALEX. Then it turned and walked toward the door.

"Have a good rest of your shift," it called over its shoulder, and then it was gone.

I stood there for a long moment, trying to process what had just happened. The timestamp on the monitors was moving forward again: 3:35 AM. 3:36 AM. But something felt different now, like the air in the store had changed composition.

From the walk-in cooler, I heard my voice again: "Alex? Alex, I'm stuck in here. The door's locked from the outside. Can you help me?"

Rule 4. Don't enter the cooler if you hear your own voice calling from inside.

But now there was another voice, also mine: "Don't listen to him. He's not real. I'm the real one. I'm trapped in here."

Two versions of my voice, both pleading, both desperate. I pressed my hands over my ears, but I could still hear them, muffled but persistent.

The fluorescent lights above aisle one flickered. Then aisle two. Then three.

Rule 6: If the fluorescent lights begin flickering in sequence from front to back, you must walk the pattern in reverse until they stop.

I came out from behind the counter and hurried to the back of the store. The light above aisle four flickered just as I reached it. I started walking forward, toward aisle three, but the lights were moving faster now. By the time I reached aisle three, the pattern had already moved to aisle five, then six.

I was walking the wrong direction.

I spun around and ran toward the back of the store, trying to stay ahead of the flickering pattern, but it was accelerating. The lights were strobing now, creating a disorienting cascade of shadows that made it hard to see where I was going.

I stumbled into the endcap of aisle six just as all the lights went out at once.

Complete darkness. The only sound was the humming of the refrigerated cases and the two versions of my voice still calling from the cooler, their pleas now overlapping into an incomprehensible chorus.

Then, one by one, the lights came back on. But they revealed a store I didn't recognize.

The aisles were longer, stretching back into shadows that the fluorescent lights couldn't penetrate. The shelves were stocked with products I'd never seen before – canned goods with labels in languages that hurt to look at, snack foods in packages that seemed to shift and writhe when I wasn't looking directly at them.

The security monitors showed the old layout, the normal store, but when I looked around with my own eyes, I saw this impossible space.

Rule 2: If the security cameras show a different layout of the store than what you can see, close your eyes and count to thirteen before looking again.

I squeezed my eyes shut. One. Two. Three.

"You're getting good at this," a voice said. Not mine this time. Marcus's voice.

Four. Five. Six.

"The rules are the only thing keeping you anchored," he continued. "But each time you use them, you slip a little further. Each time the store changes, it's harder to change back."

Seven. Eight. Nine.

"I lasted three months," Marcus said. "Longer than most. But eventually, you make a mistake. Everyone does."

Ten. Eleven. Twelve.

"The thing is, Alex, I don't think I made a mistake. I think the rules changed while I wasn't looking."

Thirteen.

I opened my eyes. The store was back to normal, familiar aisles and recognizable products. But Marcus was standing at the end of aisle two, wearing the same gas station uniform, the same name tag. He looked exactly as he had in the employee photo, except his eyes were completely black.

"The rules are different now," he said. "They added a new one while you were dealing with your doppelganger. Rule Eight: Never trust anyone who claims to be a former employee."

He smiled, and his teeth were too sharp.

"But how can you follow a rule you were never told about?"

---

The fluorescent lights above me began to flicker, and my blood turned to ice water in my veins. Not random flickering—a deliberate sequence, starting from the front of the store and moving toward the back in perfect succession. Click-buzz-click. Click-buzz-click. Each light failing and recovering in turn, creating a wave of darkness that rolled through the aisles like a predator stalking its prey.

Rule 6. If the fluorescent lights begin flickering in sequence from front to back, you must walk the pattern in reverse until they stop.

I forced my legs to move, stumbling toward the back of the store as the wave of flickering lights continued its march forward. My footsteps echoed strangely in the shifting illumination, sometimes sounding like my own feet on linoleum, sometimes like something else entirely—something with too many joints, too many angles.

The pattern was reaching the middle aisles now. I hurried past the dairy section, past the freezers that hummed with mechanical malevolence, their glass doors fogged with condensation that seemed to form shapes when I wasn't looking directly at them. Behind me, I could hear Marcus's voice growing fainter but no less insistent.

"You can't run from what this place makes you become," he called out, his words distorted by distance and the strange acoustics of the store. "I tried to warn the others, but they never listened. They never listen until it's too late."

The flickering reached the back wall. Now I had to retrace the pattern, walking from back to front as the lights continued their sequence. But as I turned around, I saw that Marcus was gone. The aisle where he'd been standing was empty, filled only with the ordinary products that had no business being ordinary in a place like this.

I began walking forward, following the reverse path as the lights flickered overhead. Each step felt like I was walking deeper into something's throat, and the air grew thicker with each breath. The fluorescent bulbs buzzed and clicked above me, their rhythm hypnotic and wrong.

That's when I noticed the security monitor mounted in the corner. The screen showed the store layout, but it wasn't the same store I was walking through. On the monitor, the aisles formed a perfect spiral, curving inward toward a center point that didn't exist in the real space. And there, in the center of that impossible spiral, was a figure in a QuickStop uniform.

It was me. But the me on the screen was standing perfectly still, arms at my sides, staring directly at the camera with eyes that were completely black.

Rule 2. If the security cameras show a different layout of the store than what you can see, close your eyes and count to thirteen before looking again.

I squeezed my eyes shut and began counting, but the numbers felt wrong in my mouth. One. Two. Three. Each number seemed to echo back at me from somewhere inside the store, as if the building itself was counting along. Four. Five. Six. The fluorescent lights continued their sequence even behind my closed eyelids, the pattern of light and dark visible through my skin.

Seven. Eight. Nine. Something touched my shoulder—just a light brush, like fingers trailing across fabric. I kept my eyes closed and continued counting. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. The touch came again, more insistent this time, and I heard my own voice whisper from somewhere very close: "You can open your eyes now. It's safe."

Thirteen.

I opened my eyes. The security monitor showed the normal layout again, and I was alone in the aisle. The fluorescent lights had stopped flickering, but the silence they left behind was somehow worse than their mechanical buzzing. It was the kind of silence that felt full, pregnant with waiting things.

My watch read 3:47 AM. Still over ten hours left in my shift.

The front door chimed, and I looked toward the entrance to see a woman in a hospital gown shuffle inside. Her feet were bare and dirty, and there was something wrong with the way she moved—too fluid, like her joints bent in directions they shouldn't. She didn't look at me as she made her way toward the pharmacy section, her hospital gown trailing behind her and leaving wet footprints on the linoleum.

Rule 1. Never acknowledge or respond to any patron who enters after 3:33 AM until they have made a purchase.

I watched her browse the over-the-counter medications, her movements becoming more erratic as she searched. She would pick up a bottle, shake it next to her ear, then put it back in the wrong place. Sometimes she would open a container and sniff the contents, making small satisfied sounds that carried too far in the empty store.

From the walk-in cooler, I heard my voice again: "She's not really shopping, you know. She's looking for something that isn't there. Something that can't be bought."

I gritted my teeth and ignored the voice from the cooler. Rule 4 was clear—don't enter if you hear your own voice. It didn't say anything about not listening, but I was beginning to understand that the rules only covered the most basic survival requirements. Everything else was left to interpretation and instinct.

The woman in the hospital gown had moved to the snack aisle. She was pulling items off the shelves now—chips, crackers, candy bars—but instead of putting them in a basket, she was arranging them on the floor in some kind of pattern. A circle, with lines radiating outward like spokes on a wheel. Or like the arms of something reaching.

"Excuse me," she said without looking up from her arrangement. Her voice was dry and papery, like autumn leaves. "Do you have any cigarettes that don't burn? I need to smoke something that will last forever."

The request made my skin crawl. Cigarettes that don't burn—that wasn't an item we carried. That wasn't an item anyone carried, because it was impossible. Which meant...

Rule 5. Any customer who attempts to purchase items that are not on the shelves must be directed to fill out Form 77-B in triplicate.

I walked to the counter and opened the drawer where Marcus had left the forms. The paper felt strange under my fingers, slightly warm and textured like skin. I pulled out three copies of Form 77-B and approached the woman, careful not to step on her arrangement of snacks.

"You'll need to fill these out," I said, holding the forms at arm's length.

She looked up at me then, and I saw that her eyes were the color of old television static—gray and white and constantly shifting. "Forms," she repeated, and smiled. Her teeth were perfect and white and far too sharp. "I love forms. They make everything official, don't they? They make the impossible possible."

She took the forms from my hand, and her fingers were cold as winter soil. As soon as the papers touched her skin, words began appearing on them in handwriting that wasn't quite human—too precise, too uniform, like it had been printed by a machine that was trying very hard to mimic humanity.

"There," she said, handing the forms back to me. "All done. Now about those cigarettes..."

I looked down at the forms. In the space marked "Requested Item," she had written: "Cigarettes that burn backwards through time, unmaking the moments they touch, returning the smoker to the instant before they made their worst mistake."

The description made my eyes water. Just reading it felt like looking at something I wasn't supposed to see, like staring directly into the sun or trying to focus on the space between atoms.

"I'm sorry," I managed to say. "We don't carry that item."

Her smile widened. "But I filled out the forms. The forms make it real. The forms make it possible." She gestured to her arrangement of snacks on the floor. "I've made an offering. I've followed the procedures. Surely that counts for something."

Behind me, the walk-in cooler door creaked open. I didn't turn around, but I could feel cold air spilling out across my back, carrying with it the sound of multiple voices—all of them mine—whispering in harmony: "Give her what she wants. Give her what she needs. The forms are filled out. The ritual is complete. The transaction must be honored."

The fluorescent lights began to dim, not flickering this time but slowly fading like dying candles. The woman in the hospital gown stood up, her movements impossibly smooth, and I realized that her feet weren't touching the ground anymore. She was floating an inch above the linoleum, her toes pointed downward like a dancer frozen in mid-leap.

"The cigarettes," she repeated, and her voice was coming from everywhere now—from the speakers, from the walls, from inside my own chest. "I need to smoke away the moment I agreed to the surgery. I need to burn backwards to the day I said yes. The forms are complete. The transaction is binding."

My hands were shaking as I looked down at Form 77-B. The writing was spreading across the page now, filling in sections I hadn't noticed before. In the space marked "Employee Authorization," my own signature was appearing in ink that looked suspiciously like blood.

I hadn't signed anything.

The break room door rattled violently, even though it was supposed to remain locked until 4 AM. Something was throwing itself against it from the inside, and with each impact, I could hear a voice that might have been Marcus screaming: "Don't let her complete the transaction! Some purchases can't be undone! Some sales damn everyone involved!"

But the forms were filled out. The customer had followed the procedures. And somewhere in the deepest part of my mind, I was beginning to understand that the rules weren't just about survival—they were about maintaining the delicate balance of whatever this place really was. Break the rules, and chaos. Follow them, and...

The woman extended her hand, palm up, waiting.

The voices from the cooler whispered in unison: "Give her the cigarettes that don't exist. Complete the impossible sale. Make the transaction that will change everything."

My hand moved toward the cigarette display behind the counter, even though I knew there were no cigarettes there that could burn backwards through time. But as my fingers touched the glass, I saw them—a pack I'd never noticed before, with a label written in a language that hurt to look at.

The clock on the wall read 4:13 AM, but I was certain it had been 3:47 just moments ago.

Time was already starting to burn.

---

The cigarettes were real. My trembling fingers traced the edges of the packs that shouldn't exist—brands I'd never heard of with names that seemed to shift when I wasn't looking directly at them. "Eternal Rest," "Final Draw," "Last Breath." The cellophane crinkled under my touch, solid and undeniable.

The woman in the hospital gown stood motionless at the counter, her form-filled hand extended toward me. The papers rustled with a sound like dried leaves, like whispered secrets, like the last exhale of dying lungs. I could see my own signature at the bottom of each page, written in handwriting that was mine but somehow wrong—the letters too sharp, the pressure too heavy, as if something else had guided my hand while I slept.

"The transaction must be completed," she said, and her voice carried the weight of absolute certainty. "You have provided the inventory. Payment is due."

Behind her, the fluorescent lights began their familiar sequence, flickering from front to back. But this time, something was different. The pattern was faster, more urgent, and with each flash I caught glimpses of other figures in the store—shadowy customers browsing aisles that didn't exist, their movements jerky and unnatural like old film reels skipping frames.

I forced myself to move, walking the pattern in reverse as Rule 6 demanded. Back to front, stepping carefully between the entities that flickered in and out of existence with each strobe of dying light. One step, two steps, three—and with each movement, the hospital gown woman's smile grew wider, revealing teeth that were too white, too sharp, too many.

"You're learning," she whispered. "Following the rules like a good employee. Marcus tried to break them, you know. That's why he's still here."

The lights stopped flickering, but the damage was done. The store had changed again. Aisles stretched deeper into shadows that the overhead lighting couldn't penetrate. Products lined shelves that extended far beyond where the walls should have been. And everywhere, the soft sound of footsteps, of breathing, of things that shouldn't be moving in the spaces between spaces.

I backed toward the counter, never taking my eyes off the woman. "What do you want?"

"What was promised," she said, sliding the forms across the counter's surface. The papers moved like living things, edges rippling, text rearranging itself as I watched. "The transaction was initiated. The merchandise was provided. Now comes the payment."

"I didn't sign anything," I said, but even as the words left my mouth, I could see my signature growing darker on the pages, as if invisible ink was responding to the heat of my denial.

"Signatures are just formalities," the woman replied. "You accepted the position. You learned the rules. You followed them. Each act of compliance is a signature of its own."

The security monitors behind me buzzed with static, and I heard Marcus's voice again, more desperate now: "Don't complete the transaction! Whatever she's asking for, don't—"

His words cut off abruptly, replaced by the sound of something heavy slamming against the break room door. The clock on the wall read 4:13 AM, but I could swear it had been 3:47 just moments ago. Time was becoming unreliable, stretching and compressing like taffy in the heat.

"Marcus understands now," the woman said conversationally. "He tried to warn the last employee too. And the one before that. They never listen. The rules are clear—the break room door must remain locked between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM. But what happens when 4:00 AM never comes?"

I glanced at the clock again. Still 4:13. The second hand ticked forward, then backward, then stopped entirely. The red digital numbers flickered, showing 4:13, then 3:47, then 4:13 again, trapped in an endless loop.

"You're cheating," I said. "The rules say—"

"The rules say many things," she interrupted. "But who do you think wrote them?"

The forms on the counter began to multiply, spreading across the surface like spilled water. Page after page of Form 77-B, each one bearing my signature, each one requesting items that couldn't exist. And in the margins, in handwriting that definitely wasn't mine, notes began to appear:

*Employee shows excellent compliance.*
*Follows instructions without question.*
*Ready for permanent assignment.*

"Permanent assignment?" I read aloud, and the woman's smile became something that hurt to look at directly.

"Every store needs a night manager," she said. "Someone to ensure the rules are followed. Someone to guide the new employees when they arrive. Marcus has been doing such good work, but he's grown... resistant. We need someone fresh. Someone eager to please."

The walk-in cooler door swung open with a metallic groan, and my own voice drifted out: "Come in here. It's safe. I found a way out." But I was standing right here, at the counter, my mouth firmly closed. The voice continued, more insistent: "Don't listen to her. I'm the real you. She's keeping you trapped out there."

Rule 4. Don't enter the walk-in cooler if you can hear your own voice calling from inside. But what happened when your own voice was calling from inside while you were definitely, certainly standing outside?

"Confusing, isn't it?" the woman said, following my gaze. "The rules assume a certain... stability of self. But employment here requires flexibility. Adaptability. The willingness to be in multiple places at once."

More voices joined the chorus from the cooler—all mine, all slightly different, all calling out warnings and pleas and contradictory instructions. Some sounded panicked, others resigned, a few almost cheerful in their acceptance. How many employees had there been? How many versions of how many people, all trapped in their own personal loops of compliance and horror?

"The beauty of the system," the woman continued, "is that it's self-sustaining. Each new employee trains the next. Each shift manager guides their replacement. Marcus will help you, just as you'll help whoever comes after."

"And if I refuse?" I asked, though I already knew the answer.

She gestured to the forms, to my signatures multiplying across the pages, to the cigarettes that shouldn't exist but did. "The transaction is already complete. You provided the merchandise. You followed the procedures. You accepted the position the moment you walked through that door."

The security monitors flickered, showing the store from impossible angles—from inside the cooler, from behind the break room door, from somewhere high above where no cameras were mounted. In each view, I could see myself standing at the counter, but the details were wrong. Different clothes, different expressions, different levels of resignation or terror or acceptance.

"Those are the other shifts," the woman explained helpfully. "Morning, afternoon, evening, night, and the spaces between. You'll get used to seeing yourself from the outside. Most employees find it comforting after a while—knowing that there's always someone else to take over when things become too much to bear."

I tried to step away from the counter, but my feet wouldn't move. Looking down, I saw that my shoes had somehow become part of the floor, the rubber soles melding seamlessly with the worn linoleum. The store uniform I'd never put on was materializing around my clothes—a name tag reading "EMPLOYEE #847" pinning itself to my chest, a company vest wrapping itself around my shoulders.

"The orientation is almost complete," the woman said, and now her voice was coming from everywhere at once—the speakers, the vents, the very walls themselves. "Just one more formality."

She held out a pen that gleamed like polished bone. "Sign here for your permanent assignment."

The forms had consolidated into a single document now, official and binding, with letterhead that read "NIGHT SHIFT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT" in letters that seemed to move when I wasn't looking directly at them. The terms were simple: eternal employment, competitive benefits including immortality and omnipresence, with the small caveat that termination was not possible under any circumstances.

"Marcus signed his," the woman said encouragingly. "Eventually. They all do. The alternative is so much worse."

From the break room came the sound of scratching, of fingernails against wood, of someone trying desperately to claw their way out. The clock still read 4:13 AM, trapped in its endless moment between authorized hours and whatever came after.

I looked at the pen, at the contract, at the woman whose hospital gown was now clearly stained with something dark and spreading. Behind her, the store stretched into infinity, aisles upon aisles of products that no living person should ever need, tended by employees who had learned the rules so well they could never leave.

"What happens to the customers?" I asked.

"What customers?" she replied, and her laugh was the sound of fluorescent lights dying. "There are only employees here. Customers are just employees who haven't been properly oriented yet."

The pen felt warm in my hand, almost alive, pulsing with a rhythm that matched my heartbeat. The signature line waited, patient and inevitable, while somewhere in the distance, my own voice continued calling from the cooler, promising safety that couldn't exist and escape that would never come.

The rules were clear. The transaction was complete. The only question left was whether I would sign willingly or wait for the store to take what it needed anyway.

Outside, dawn would never come. Inside, the night shift was eternal.

And I was learning that some jobs, once accepted, could never be quit.

---

The fluorescent lights above me flickered in their familiar sequence, front to back, and I walked the pattern in reverse without thinking. My feet knew the steps now, muscle memory carved into whatever I was becoming. The lights steadied, and I returned to my position behind the counter, watching the monitors that showed me truths I didn't want to see.

Employee #847. That's what the name tag said now. I couldn't remember when it had changed from the temporary visitor badge I'd worn when I first arrived. Time worked differently here, folding in on itself like the aisles that stretched impossibly deep into the store's belly.

The break room door rattled behind me. 2:47 AM. Still locked, as it should be. As it must be. The rattling intensified, and I heard Marcus's voice again, pleading.

"Please, I just want to go home. My shift ended hours ago. Days ago. Please."

I didn't turn around. Rule 7 was absolute. The door stayed locked between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM, regardless of who or what requested entry. Even if that voice belonged to Marcus, Employee #231, who'd been asking to leave for what felt like months now. Even if I could hear him crying.

The security monitor flickered, and suddenly the store layout was wrong again. The aisles curved in spirals, creating a nautilus shell pattern that hurt to look at. I closed my eyes and counted to thirteen, feeling my breath fog in air that had grown cold without warning. When I opened them, the aisles were straight again, but now they stretched so far back that the emergency exit signs were just pinpricks of red light in the distance.

A customer entered. The door chime played its discordant melody, and I checked the clock. 3:45 AM. I could acknowledge this one, once they made a purchase. They wore a hospital gown that dragged behind them, leaving wet streaks on the linoleum. Their feet were bare and blue-white with cold.

They wandered the aisles, and I watched them on the monitors. Camera 3 showed them in the snack aisle, reaching for chips that weren't there. Camera 5 showed them in the cooler section, their breath visible in the sudden chill. Camera 7 showed them standing in an aisle that didn't exist, surrounded by shelves of items I couldn't identify—bottles filled with shifting shadows, boxes that seemed to breathe.

They approached the counter with empty hands.

"I'd like to buy a way out," they said. Their voice was hollow, echoing as if spoken from the bottom of a well.

Items not on the shelves. I knew this routine now. I reached under the counter and pulled out Form 77-B, the paper yellow and brittle. "You'll need to fill this out in triplicate," I said, sliding it across to them.

Their fingers left damp prints on the paper. As they wrote, I caught glimpses of what they were filling in. Name: Sarah Chen, Employee #1,247. Department: Night Shift Convenience. Requested Item: Freedom. Reason for Request: I want to see my daughter again.

The cooler compressor kicked on, and through its mechanical hum, I heard my own voice calling from inside. "Hey, can you help me back here? I think I'm lost." 

Rule 4. Don't enter the cooler if you hear your own voice calling from inside. But the voice was getting more insistent, more desperate. "Please, I've been walking for hours. There's no way out. The aisles just keep going deeper."

Sarah looked up from her form. "That's you, isn't it? You're in there too."

I nodded. "Employee #847-B, probably. Maybe #847-C. There are a lot of us now."

She finished filling out the form and slid all three copies back to me. I stamped them with a rubber stamp that had appeared beside the register—when had that happened? The stamp left a mark that looked like a barcode, but the lines writhed and shifted when I wasn't looking directly at them.

"Your request has been processed," I told her. "Please wait for approval."

"How long does that usually take?"

I gestured around the store. "Marcus has been waiting since Tuesday. Or maybe it was last Tuesday. Time gets... flexible here."

She nodded as if this made perfect sense, then walked to the magazine rack to wait. But when I looked at the monitors, she was also still standing at the counter. And walking down aisle 3. And sitting in the break room, even though the door was locked. Multiple Sarahs, all waiting for the same approval that would never come.

The phone rang. I answered it automatically. "Night Owl Convenience, Employee #847 speaking."

"This is corporate," said a voice that sounded like my own voice, but older, more tired. "We need you to extend your shift. The day employee called in sick."

"For how long?"

"Indefinitely."

I hung up and made a note in the logbook that had materialized beside the register. The pages were filled with entries in handwriting that looked like mine, documenting shift extensions going back months. Years. The dates didn't make sense—some were from next week, others from decades ago.

A new customer entered. The door chime played a different tune this time, something that might have been a lullaby if played backward. This customer looked familiar—it was me, but wearing a day shift uniform. The name tag read Employee #847-D.

"Excuse me," the other me said. "I'm here for orientation. I was told to report to the night manager."

"That would be me," I said.

"But I'm supposed to work days."

I pointed to the schedule taped beside the register. Every slot, day and night, was filled with variations of my name. Employee #847, #847-B, #847-C, continuing down in neat handwriting until the numbers became too small to read.

"There are no day shifts," I explained. "Only night. Only here. Only now."

The other me nodded and walked to the uniform closet that had appeared beside the break room door. When they opened it, I saw rows of identical polo shirts and name tags, all numbered in sequence. They selected one and pinned it to their chest: Employee #847-E.

The break room door stopped rattling. Through the sudden silence, I heard Marcus's voice one more time, fainter now: "I understand. I'll wait for my replacement."

But there would be no replacement. There never was. Only more of us, arriving for orientations that never ended, working shifts that never concluded, serving customers who were just employees who hadn't been processed yet.

The fluorescent lights flickered again, but this time the pattern was different. Instead of front to back, they flickered in the shape of numbers: 8-4-7. My employee number, written in light. I didn't know what rule covered this, so I just watched as the pattern repeated, over and over, hypnotic and somehow comforting.

Sarah approached the counter again, or maybe it was a different Sarah. "Excuse me, I'm here for my first day. I was told to report to the night manager."

I handed her a name tag: Employee #1,247-A. "Welcome to the Night Owl," I said. "Let me explain the rules."

As I began reciting them—rules I knew by heart now, rules that had become part of my DNA—I caught my reflection in the security monitor. For just a moment, I saw myself as I had been when I first arrived: confused, frightened, still believing I could leave. Then the image shifted, and I saw myself as I was now: part of the store's ecosystem, as permanent as the shelves and registers.

The cooler compressor cycled off, and in the sudden quiet, I heard new voices calling from inside. Sarah's voice. Marcus's voice. The voices of employees I hadn't met yet but would, eventually, inevitably.

"Don't go in there," I told Sarah as she looked toward the cooler. "Rule 4. If you hear your own voice calling from inside, don't enter."

She nodded and wrote it down in a notebook that had appeared in her hands. The first rule she'd learned, but not the last. Never the last.

The clock above the door ticked forward: 4:00 AM. I unlocked the break room door, and Marcus stumbled out, looking dazed. His name tag read Employee #231-F now.

"What time is it?" he asked.

"Time for your next shift," I said, handing him a fresh uniform. "The night is young."

He looked at the windows, but they showed only darkness. They always showed only darkness now. Day and night had become meaningless concepts, replaced by the eternal fluorescent twilight of the Night Owl.

More customers entered—employees-to-be, all of them, though they didn't know it yet. The door chime played its discordant welcome, and I prepared to explain the rules again. And again. And again.

Because that's what we did here. We served. We waited. We followed the rules.

And we never, ever left.

The store stretched around us, infinite and hungry, always ready for the next shift, the next employee, the next soul to feed its endless appetite for service.

I straightened my name tag—Employee #847—and smiled at the approaching customer.

"Welcome to the Night Owl," I said. "How can I help you?"

---

The fluorescent lights had been flickering in their sequence for what felt like hours now, front to back, front to back, an endless cascade of dying illumination that painted everything in strobing shadows. I walked the pattern in reverse, heel to toe, heel to toe, from the back of the store to the front, then turned and did it again. And again. The lights never stopped.

My feet had worn a path in the linoleum. I could feel the groove beneath my shoes, smooth and deep like water erosion. How long had I been walking? The clock above the register still read 3:47 AM, but the hands moved in different directions now—sometimes backwards, sometimes spinning wildly, sometimes stopping entirely while the second hand ticked in perfect rhythm with my heartbeat.

The customers watched me walk. They always watched. The woman in the hospital gown sat in aisle three, her bare feet dangling from where she perched on the edge of a shelf that shouldn't have been able to support her weight. Her toes were blue-black with frostbite, and when she smiled at me, ice crystals fell from her lips to shatter on the floor.

"You're getting good at that," she said, her voice carrying the hollow echo of the walk-in cooler. "Marcus took weeks to learn the pattern properly. But you... you're special."

I didn't respond. Rule One was still in effect—she'd entered after 3:33 AM and hadn't made a purchase. The rules were all that mattered now. The rules were all that kept the store running, and the store had to keep running. It had always been running. It would always be running.

Behind the counter, three versions of myself worked the register simultaneously. One rang up a customer buying cigarettes that turned to ash in his fingers. Another counted exact change that multiplied and divided as it passed from hand to hand. The third simply stared at the security monitors, watching the store reshape itself in real-time.

I was all of them. I was none of them. I was the one walking the pattern while the lights flickered, and I was also the one who had never left the counter, and I was also the one who had died in the cooler weeks ago, and I was also the one who hadn't arrived yet but would soon.

The bell above the door chimed, and another customer entered. He looked exactly like me, but wearing the clothes I'd had on when I first arrived—jeans and a t-shirt instead of the blue vest that had somehow grown onto my skin. This version of me looked around with wide, frightened eyes.

"Excuse me," he said, approaching the counter where I wasn't standing. "I think I'm lost. My car broke down and—"

The me behind the register didn't look up from the security monitors. Rule One. After 3:33 AM, no acknowledgment until purchase. The new me—the fresh me, the one who still thought he could leave—grew increasingly agitated.

"Hello? Can you help me? I just need to use your phone."

I continued walking the pattern. Front to back, back to front. The lights flickered in their sequence, and I followed in reverse. This was my function now. This was what I did. What I had always done.

The fresh version of myself finally grabbed a candy bar from the display and slammed it on the counter. "There! I'm buying something! Now can you please help me?"

The me behind the register looked up with eyes that reflected the fluorescent strobing. "Cash only after midnight," I heard myself say. "Exact change."

"I don't have exact change! Can't you just—"

"Exact change only."

I watched this play out while I walked. I remembered this conversation, but also I was having it for the first time, but also it had happened countless times before with countless versions of myself. The fresh me would eventually find exact change. He would make the purchase. Then the real orientation would begin.

The woman in the hospital gown hopped down from her shelf and approached the new arrival. Ice crystals trailed behind her like a wedding veil made of winter.

"First time?" she asked him, and her breath came out in visible puffs despite the store's oppressive heat.

"I just need help," the fresh me said, backing away from her. "My car—"

"Broke down. Yes, they always do. Right around mile marker 47, wasn't it? Just past the billboard for the adult bookstore that's been closed for fifteen years?"

The fresh me's face went pale. "How did you—"

"Because that's where everyone's car breaks down. That's where everyone sees the lights of this place and thinks, 'Thank God, somewhere to get help.' But there's no help here, honey. There's only work."

The lights continued their sequence. I continued my reverse walk. The pattern had to be maintained. If I stopped, if I broke the rhythm, the lights would stay broken and the store would... what? I couldn't remember what would happen. I only knew it would be wrong, and wrongness was the only thing worse than this endless twilight of fluorescent employment.

My phone rang. The me behind the counter answered it while simultaneously ringing up the candy bar that the fresh me had finally found exact change for.

"Night Owl Convenience, this is... this is..." The me on the phone paused, confused. What was my name? I had had a name once. I was walking and I was answering the phone and I was sure I had had a name.

"This is Employee," I said into the phone, and that felt right. That felt true.

"Employee, this is Corporate," said a voice that sounded exactly like mine but older, more tired. "We're calling to check on your progress."

"Progress is... progressing," I said, watching the security monitors while I walked the pattern while I completed the transaction. The monitors showed seventeen different layouts of the store simultaneously. In some, I was walking. In others, I was behind the counter. In one, I was in the cooler, frozen solid but still stocking shelves. In another, I was sitting in the break room that didn't exist anymore, filling out Form 77-B in triplicate while something with my voice pounded on the door.

"Excellent. And the new hire?"

I looked at the fresh version of myself, who was now staring in horror at his receipt. Instead of showing a candy bar purchase, it listed his employment start date, his shift schedule, and his employee ID number.

"Processing," I said into the phone.

"Very good. Remember, Employee—the store must remain operational. The customers must be served. The rules must be followed."

"The rules must be followed," I agreed, and hung up.

The fresh me was reading his receipt over and over, his hands shaking. "This is wrong," he said. "This is all wrong. I didn't apply for a job. I just wanted help."

The woman in the hospital gown laughed, and the sound was like ice breaking on a frozen lake. "Oh, sweetie. Everyone applies eventually. The application is just walking through that door."

"No," the fresh me said, backing toward the exit. "No, I'm leaving. I'm getting out of here."

He reached for the door handle, but his hand passed through it like it was made of smoke. He tried again, pushing harder, but the door had become insubstantial. The exit was still there—I could see it, we could all see it—but it was no longer a way out. It was just part of the scenery now, like a painted backdrop in a theater.

"The door stops working after you make your first purchase," explained the woman. "That's not one of the official rules, but it's a rule nonetheless. You bought something. You're part of the store now. You're inventory."

The fresh me pounded on the glass, but it made no sound. His mouth opened in a scream, but what came out was the soft chime of the cash register.

I felt sorry for him. I remembered that terror, that desperate need to escape. But I also felt relief that there would be another employee to help with the workload. The store was getting busier. More customers every night, and they all needed to be served according to the rules. All of them would eventually make purchases. All of them would eventually join the staff.

The lights finished their sequence and began again immediately. Front to back, front to back. I turned and walked the reverse pattern. Heel to toe, heel to toe. This was my job now. This was what I did.

The woman in the hospital gown approached the fresh me, who had collapsed against the unworkable door.

"What's your name, honey?" she asked.

"I..." He looked confused, the same confusion I had felt when Corporate called. "I don't... I had a name. I know I had a name."

"Names don't matter here. We're all just Employee now. But don't worry—you'll get used to it. We all do."

She was right. I was getting used to it. The walking, the rules, the endless fluorescent twilight. It wasn't so bad once you accepted it. Once you understood that this was simply how things were now. How they had always been.

The fresh me would learn. They always did.

I continued walking the pattern while the lights flickered their eternal sequence, and somewhere in the distance, I could hear my own voice calling from the cooler, inviting me to come inside where it was cool and dark and quiet.

But I had work to do.

The store had to keep running.

---

The corporate voice continued its relentless cataloging, but I found I could hear it from seventeen different positions throughout the store simultaneously. Each version of myself was listening, each one filing away the inventory updates with perfect compliance. The woman in the hospital gown had stopped trying to leave—she understood now, as they all eventually did.

"Employee," she said to me, though I wasn't sure which me she was addressing. "How long have you been here?"

I opened my mouth to answer, but seventeen different responses came out at once, layered over each other like a discordant choir. Some said days. Some said years. One said forever. Another insisted it had only been a few hours, that the morning shift would arrive soon and everything would return to normal.

But there was no normal here. There never had been.

The security monitors showed me all seventeen layouts of the store, and I could see myself in each one—standing behind different registers, stocking different shelves, mopping different floors. In one layout, I was helping the impossible customer find items that existed only in the spaces between reality. In another, I was arguing with Marcus about proper procedure while he flickered in and out of existence. In a third, I was standing perfectly still in the walk-in cooler, my mouth open as if calling out, though no sound emerged.

"The rules," I said, and my voice echoed from every corner of the store. "I know all the rules now."

The fluorescent lights began their sequence again—front to back, front to back—and I walked the pattern in reverse. But this time, I walked it in all seventeen layouts simultaneously. My feet traced impossible geometries across overlapping floor plans, and with each step, I felt myself spreading thinner, becoming more integrated into the store's essential structure.

The woman in the hospital gown was filling out Form 77-B in triplicate, though she'd given up trying to purchase items that weren't on the shelves. Now she was simply writing her name over and over again, watching it fade from the paper as soon as the ink dried.

"It doesn't matter what we write," she said. "The forms just reset themselves."

I nodded from behind the register, though I was also nodding from the dairy aisle and the magazine rack and the employee break room that was somehow no longer locked despite the time being 3:17 AM. Time had become negotiable here, subject to the store's needs rather than any external authority.

The corporate voice crackled through the speakers: "Attention employees. We are pleased to announce that our customer satisfaction ratings have reached an all-time high of 100%. This is due to the dedication and compliance of our staff in following all posted regulations. Remember: the customer is always right, even when they're wrong. Especially when they're wrong."

A new customer entered through the front door—a man in a mechanic's jumpsuit with oil stains that moved like living things across the fabric. He looked around with the familiar expression of someone who'd broken down at mile marker 47, who'd walked past the closed adult bookstore, who'd seen our lights and thought salvation had arrived.

I didn't acknowledge him. It was after 3:33 AM, and Rule 1 was absolute. He would have to make a purchase first, and once he did, the door would become insubstantial for him as well. Another employee for our growing staff.

But something was different this time. As the man approached the counter, I noticed he wasn't looking at the merchandise. He was looking at me—at all of me, somehow seeing through the seventeen overlapping versions to something underneath.

"You're not supposed to be here," he said.

The corporate voice stuttered, feedback squealing through the speakers. The fluorescent lights stopped their sequence mid-pattern, leaving half the store in shadow. Even the voice from the cooler fell silent.

"I'm sorry," I said, following protocol. "I cannot acknowledge customers who enter after 3:33 AM until they have made a purchase."

"You're not an employee," the man continued, ignoring my response. "You're a customer. You made a purchase, didn't you? That's how it starts. That's how it always starts."

I felt something shift inside my chest—a memory trying to surface through layers of compliance and integration. A receipt. I'd bought something when I first arrived. Energy drinks and beef jerky. Exact change, because it was after midnight and Rule 3 was absolute.

"The receipt," I whispered, and seventeen versions of my voice whispered it back from throughout the store.

The man nodded. "Check your pocket."

I reached into my jacket pocket—the same pocket I'd reached into so many times to count exact change for impossible transactions. My fingers found paper, crisp and new despite everything that had happened. I pulled it out, and the fluorescent lights flickered back to life, revealing the truth I'd been avoiding.

The receipt was an employment contract. At the bottom, in small print that seemed to writhe and shift as I read it, were the terms of service: "Payment of goods constitutes acceptance of employment. Employee agrees to maintain store operations in perpetuity. Employee agrees to forfeit individual identity in service of corporate compliance. Employee agrees that this contract supersedes all prior existence."

And there, at the very bottom, was my signature. Not the scrawled approximation I'd been using for the past... how long had it been? This was my real signature, the one I'd signed without reading, without understanding what I was agreeing to.

"You can leave," the man said. "But you have to choose. Stay and be the store forever, or go and let someone else take your place."

I looked around at the seventeen layouts, at the impossible customers and the shadow employees and the woman in the hospital gown who was still filling out forms that would never be processed. They were all looking at me now, waiting.

"If I leave," I said, "what happens to them?"

The man's oil-stained jumpsuit flickered, revealing something else underneath—a uniform shirt with a name tag that read 'Employee.' "Someone has to run the store," he said. "Someone always has to run the store. The question is whether it's going to be you."

I felt the weight of the decision settling over me like a heavy coat. I could walk away, push through the door that would become solid again just long enough for me to escape. I could return to my life, my real life, whatever that had been before I'd broken down and seen the lights and made the choice to stop.

But the woman in the hospital gown would remain. Marcus would continue his eternal shift. The voice in the cooler would keep calling out to new employees, and the corporate announcements would continue their endless loop of meaningless directives.

Or I could stay. I could accept what I'd already become, let myself spread fully into the store's structure, become the guiding intelligence that kept the rules in place and the customers trapped and the whole impossible system running smoothly.

"There's a third option," I said, surprising myself.

The man raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"

I looked at the receipt in my hand—the contract I'd signed without reading. "What if I void the transaction?"

The store went completely silent. Even the hum of the refrigeration units stopped. The fluorescent lights dimmed to almost nothing, casting everything in a sickly amber glow.

"That's not allowed," the corporate voice said, but it sounded uncertain now, distorted. "All sales are final. No returns, no exchanges, no refunds."

"But what if the transaction was fraudulent?" I asked. "What if the customer wasn't properly informed of the terms? What if the contract is invalid due to misrepresentation?"

I walked to the register—all seventeen versions of me walked to all seventeen registers—and began typing. The keys felt strange under my fingers, like they were made of something that wasn't quite plastic, wasn't quite real. But they responded to my touch, and numbers appeared on the screen.

The receipt number. The date. The time. The items purchased.

"Initiating return," I said, and my voice echoed through every speaker in the store. "Customer was not adequately informed of employment terms. Transaction voided due to deceptive business practices."

The register screen flickered, showing error messages in languages I didn't recognize. But I kept typing, kept pushing through the system's resistance. The woman in the hospital gown looked up from her forms, hope flickering in her eyes. Marcus appeared beside me, his uniform crisp and new.

"You can't," he said. "If you void the transaction, if you break the contract..."

"What happens?" I asked. "The store closes? The customers go free? The employees get to leave?"

"The store needs someone," Marcus insisted. "It's always needed someone. If not you, then who?"

I looked at him—really looked at him for the first time since this all began. His name tag didn't say 'Employee.' It said 'Marcus,' and underneath that, in smaller text, 'Manager.'

"You," I said. "It's always been you. You're not an employee. You're the one who runs this place. You're the one who makes sure the rules are followed, who brings in new customers, who keeps the whole system going."

Marcus's form flickered, his uniform shifting from employee polo to manager's shirt to something else entirely—a suit that seemed to be cut from the same material as the shadows between the shelves.

"Someone has to," he said, but his voice was different now, layered with harmonics that made my teeth ache. "Someone always has to. The store serves a purpose. It keeps things contained that shouldn't be loose in the world. It processes people who've already been lost, who've already fallen through the cracks. Without it..."

"Without it, they'd be free," I finished.

The register screen finally cleared, showing a simple message: TRANSACTION VOIDED. REFUND PROCESSED. HAVE A NICE DAY.

The change in the store was immediate and dramatic. The fluorescent lights blazed to full brightness, revealing the true layout—a single, normal convenience store with ordinary shelves and ordinary products. The seventeen overlapping realities collapsed into one, and I felt myself snapping back together like a rubber band that had been stretched too far.

The woman in the hospital gown stood up, her forms dissolving in her hands like smoke. She looked around in confusion, then walked toward the door. It opened easily for her, and I could see dawn breaking over the parking lot outside.

"Wait," I called after her, but she was already gone, walking toward a car that definitely hadn't been there before—a sensible sedan that looked nothing like the broken-down vehicles that usually brought people to this place.

Other customers were leaving too—people I hadn't even noticed, shadow figures who became solid and real as they headed for the exit. Each one walked out into the morning light, and each one found a working vehicle waiting for them.

But Marcus remained, and his expression was no longer friendly or helpful. The shadows around him deepened, and I could see other shapes moving in the darkness behind the shelves—things that had been contained by the store's impossible geometry, things that were now looking for a new place to hide.

"You don't understand what you've done," he said. "This place was a filter. A processing center. People who ended up here were already lost—already separated from the normal flow of reality. We gave them purpose. We gave them structure. Without that..."

"Without that, they get to choose," I said. "They get to decide for themselves what happens next."

Marcus laughed, and the sound was like breaking glass. "Choose? You think any of them remember what choice feels like? You think they remember how to exist in a world with real consequences?"

I looked around the store one more time. It was still wrong—the proportions were off, the shadows fell in directions that didn't match the light sources, and I could hear whispers coming from the walk-in cooler. But it was less wrong than it had been. The rules were still there, but they were weaker now, more like suggestions than absolute commands.

"Maybe they'll figure it out," I said. "Maybe they'll remember. Or maybe they'll find something better than this."

I walked toward the door, and Marcus didn't try to stop me. But as I reached for the handle, he called out one last time.

"The receipt," he said. "You still have it. The contract might be voided, but the connection remains. You'll always be able to find your way back here. And when you do—when you inevitably do—there won't be any more loopholes to exploit."

I looked down at my hand. The receipt was still there, but it was different now. Instead of an employment contract, it was just a normal purchase record. Energy drinks and beef jerky, paid for in exact change. But at the bottom, in letters so small I had to squint to read them, was a single line: "Thank you for shopping with us. We hope to see you again soon."

I crumpled the receipt and dropped it on the floor. Then I pushed through the door and stepped out into the morning.

The parking lot was empty except for my car—my real car, not some broken-down substitute. The keys were in my pocket where they belonged, and when I turned the ignition, the engine started immediately. The gas tank was full, the radio was tuned to a station I actually listened to, and the GPS showed a clear route back to the interstate.

As I drove away, I looked in the rearview mirror one last time. The store was still there, its neon sign flickering weakly in the dawn light. But it looked smaller now, more ordinary. Just another convenience store in the middle of nowhere, the kind of place you'd stop at if you needed gas or snacks or directions.

The kind of place you'd forget about as soon as you left.

But I wouldn't forget. I couldn't. The receipt might be gone, but Marcus was right about the connection. I could feel it like a thread stretched between my chest and that fluorescent-lit building, growing thinner with distance but never quite breaking.

I drove back to my life, my real life, and tried to pretend that everything was normal. I went back to work, paid my bills, called my family. I told people I'd had car trouble on my trip, that I'd been delayed but everything worked out fine.

And for the most part, that was true.

But sometimes, late at night, I'd find myself thinking about the rules. About the importance of exact change after midnight, about the proper procedure for handling impossible customers, about the necessity of keeping certain doors locked at certain times.

And sometimes, when I was driving on empty highways in the small hours of the morning, I'd see lights in the distance and feel a pull in my chest, a whisper that maybe I should stop, maybe I should check if they needed help, maybe I should see how things were going.

I never did, though. I kept driving, kept moving forward, kept telling myself that I'd made the right choice.

But the thread was still there, and it was getting stronger.

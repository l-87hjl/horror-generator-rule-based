# FIRE WATCH PROTOCOL DOCUMENT

**Cascade Peak Fire Watch Station**  
**Forest Service Employee Orientation Materials**  
**Season: June-October**

Welcome to Cascade Peak Fire Watch Station. Your employment begins immediately upon signing this document. The following protocols are mandatory and non-negotiable. Failure to comply will result in immediate termination and forfeiture of all wages.

## SEVEN PROTOCOLS FOR FIRE WATCH DUTY

**PROTOCOL ONE**: Maintain watch from sunrise to sunset. Record all smoke sightings in the logbook with coordinates, time, and estimated distance. Submit daily reports via radio at 1800 hours.

**PROTOCOL TWO**: Never leave the tower platform between the hours of 0600 and 1800. All personal needs must be attended to before or after watch hours.

**PROTOCOL THREE**: If you observe movement in the forest that is not smoke, fire, or wildlife, do not report it. Do not record it in any log. Do not acknowledge it in any way.

**PROTOCOL FOUR**: The observation deck has four windows, one facing each cardinal direction. You must rotate your observation in a clockwise pattern: North, East, South, West. Complete one full rotation every fifteen minutes. Do not skip directions. Do not vary the pattern.

**PROTOCOL FIVE**: If the radio transmits any communication outside of your scheduled report time, respond only with your station designation and current date. Do not engage in conversation. Do not answer questions.

**PROTOCOL SIX**: At sunset, descend immediately to the living quarters. Secure all shutters on the observation deck before descending. Do not return to the observation deck until sunrise.

**PROTOCOL SEVEN**: You are permitted three violations of Protocols Two through Six during your employment period. Upon the third violation, you must descend the tower permanently and walk to the trailhead. Your employment will be terminated. Your final paycheck will be mailed to your address of record.

I signed the document without reading it carefully. That was my first mistake, though not one of the three that would matter.

The helicopter pilot who flew me up to Cascade Peak didn't say much. He was Forest Service, weathered face, aviator sunglasses that hid whatever he thought about depositing another warm body at this remote station. When we landed on the small pad cut into the rock near the tower's base, he handed me two duffel bags—one mine, one Forest Service issue—and a laminated copy of the protocol document.

"Read it," he said. "Every word. Every day if you need to."

"I signed it already."

"Read it anyway." He pulled a small device from his pocket, like a garage door opener, with a single red LED. "This stays with you. Don't lose it. When it lights up, you've got one violation logged. It'll light up three times total. After the third time, you walk out. Understand?"

I took the device. It was heavier than it looked, warm from his pocket or from something else. "What if I need to leave before then?"

"Then you walk out. But you don't get paid." He climbed back into the helicopter. "Someone will check on you in October. Maybe."

The rotor wash nearly knocked me over as he lifted off. I watched the helicopter disappear over the ridge, then turned to look at my new home.

The tower was a standard Forest Service design: a sixty-foot steel frame supporting a small cabin with windows on all sides. A wooden staircase wrapped around the frame, climbing in switchbacks to the observation deck at the top. Below the tower, a smaller structure—the living quarters—had been built into the rock face, partially underground for insulation.

It was June 15th. I had four and a half months until October.

I was twenty-three years old and running from a life that had collapsed in the usual ways: bad relationship, worse decisions, debt, disappointment. The job posting had promised isolation, decent pay, and "minimal human contact." I'd applied the same day I read it.

The climb to the observation deck took longer than I expected. My legs burned by the third switchback. The stairs were solid but narrow, and the wind picked up as I climbed, making the whole structure sway slightly. By the time I reached the top, I was breathing hard and reconsidering my life choices.

The observation deck was a twelve-by-twelve room with windows on all four walls and a door that opened onto a small catwalk. A desk stood in the center with a fire finder—a circular map with a rotating sight for taking bearings. Binoculars hung from hooks on each wall. A radio sat on the desk, its power light glowing green. A logbook lay open, pages blank.

The view was extraordinary. I could see for miles in every direction: ridge after ridge of Douglas fir and western hemlock, punctuated by rocky outcrops and the occasional alpine meadow. To the north, Mount Rainier rose like a white ghost on the horizon. No roads. No buildings. No people.

I checked my watch: 4:47 PM. Sunset wasn't until after eight, which gave me time to explore before my first watch period ended.

The living quarters below were spartan but functional: a narrow bed, a propane stove, a small table, shelves with canned goods and dried food, a chemical toilet in a closet. A rain barrel outside collected water. Solar panels on the roof charged a battery bank for the radio and a few LED lights.

I found a previous occupant's notes tucked into a Bible on the shelf:

*Day 43: Saw it again today during the 1400 rotation. Didn't report. Didn't look at it directly. It stayed at the treeline for six minutes. I timed it.*

*Day 67: Radio asked me questions last night. I only gave designation and date. It sounded like my sister but she died in 2015.*

*Day 89: Two violations now. The light came on when I looked south before completing the east observation. I thought I saw smoke but it was just clouds. Have to be more careful.*

*Day 91: Walking out today. Can't do this anymore. If you're reading this—don't try to understand the rules. Just follow them exactly. Don't think about why.*

The note wasn't dated. The Bible was a Gideon edition from 1987.

I went back up to the observation deck. The sun was lowering toward the western ridges, painting everything gold and shadow. I picked up the binoculars at the north window and began my first rotation.

North: Ridgelines stepping down toward distant civilization. A creek glinting in the valley. No smoke.

East: The spine of the Cascades, peaks still holding snow in their high bowls. No smoke.

South: Dense forest descending into a canyon. No smoke.

West: The sun blazing through the trees, making me squint. No smoke.

I recorded it all in the logbook: date, time, conditions, observations. At 1800 hours, I picked up the radio handset.

"Cascade Peak Station, June 15th, 1800 hours. No smoke sightings. Visibility excellent. Conditions clear."

The radio crackled. "Received, Cascade Peak. Report tomorrow 1800 hours."

The voice was neutral, neither male nor female, processed through compression and static.

At sunset—8:34 PM according to the almanac posted on the wall—I closed the shutters on all four windows, securing them with their latches. The observation deck went dark except for the LED lantern I'd brought up. I descended to the living quarters and made dinner: canned chili heated on the propane stove, crackers, an apple from the supplies.

The device the pilot had given me sat on the table. Its LED remained dark.

I slept poorly that first night. The tower creaked in the wind. Small animals scurried in the walls. I kept thinking about the note I'd found, about someone timing how long something stayed at the treeline. About a radio that asked questions in a dead sister's voice.

At 5:47 AM, I woke to my alarm. Sunrise was at 5:52. I climbed to the observation deck in the pre-dawn gray and opened the shutters in order: north, east, south, west. The mountains emerged from darkness like whales surfacing.

I began my rotation at 6:00 AM exactly.

The first week passed uneventfully. I fell into the rhythm: wake before sunrise, open shutters, begin rotation. North, East, South, West, every fifteen minutes. Record observations. Submit report at 1800 hours. Close shutters at sunset. Descend. Sleep.

The rotation was hypnotic. Every fifteen minutes, I'd move from window to window, scanning the landscape through binoculars, checking for the telltale column of smoke that would mean fire. My world became quadrants, cardinal directions, the sweep of my gaze across ridgelines and valleys.

I saw plenty of wildlife: deer, elk, a black bear fishing in a creek, hawks riding thermals, ravens. I recorded none of them. Protocol One specified smoke sightings only.

On day eight, during the 1330 rotation, I saw something at the treeline to the south.

It was roughly human-shaped but wrong in ways I couldn't immediately articulate. Too tall, perhaps, or too still. It stood among the trees about a quarter mile down the slope, visible through the binoculars but barely noticeable to the naked eye.

Protocol Three came back to me: *If you observe movement in the forest that is not smoke, fire, or wildlife, do not report it. Do not record it in any log. Do not acknowledge it in any way.*

I lowered the binoculars. I turned to the west window and continued my rotation as if I'd seen nothing.

My hands were shaking.

When I came back to the south window fifteen minutes later, the figure was gone.

That night, the radio crackled to life at 2:17 AM.

"Cascade Peak Station, do you copy?"

I was in bed, half-asleep. The radio was in the observation deck above me, but I could hear it clearly through the floor.

"Cascade Peak Station, respond please."

Protocol Five: *If the radio transmits any communication outside of your scheduled report time, respond only with your station designation and current date. Do not engage in conversation. Do not answer questions.*

I climbed to the observation deck. The radio's power light glowed in the darkness. I picked up the handset.

"Cascade Peak Station, June 23rd."

"Did you see it today?"

My finger hovered over the transmit button. Protocol Five said not to answer questions.

"Cascade Peak Station, June 23rd," I repeated.

"We know you saw it. Why didn't you report it?"

I wanted to say: because Protocol Three told me not to. Because I'm following the rules. Because I don't know what the fuck it was and I don't want to know.

"Cascade Peak Station, June 23rd."

The radio went silent. I waited five minutes, then descended back to bed.

The device's LED remained dark. I hadn't violated anything.

But I didn't sleep the rest of that night.

The figure appeared again on day twelve, day fifteen, day nineteen. Always during the rotation, always at the treeline, always in a different direction. North. East. West. Never the same place twice.

I followed Protocol Three. I didn't report it. I didn't record it. I didn't acknowledge it.

But I saw it.

Each time, it was a little closer.

On day twenty-three, I made my first violation.

It was during the 1445 rotation. I was at the north window, scanning the ridgeline, when I heard a sound from the south: a crack like a tree falling, loud enough to carry up the slope.

I turned to look.

The figure was standing at the base of the tower, directly below the observation deck, looking up at me.

It wasn't human. That much was clear now. It had the approximate shape—head, torso, limbs—but the proportions were wrong. The limbs too long. The head too narrow. Its surface seemed to shift between solid and translucent, like heat shimmer made flesh.

We looked at each other for perhaps three seconds.

Then I remembered Protocol Four: *Complete one full rotation every fifteen minutes. Do not skip directions. Do not vary the pattern.*

I'd turned from north to south, skipping east. I'd broken the rotation pattern.

The device in my pocket grew warm. I pulled it out. The LED glowed red.

One violation.

When I looked back down, the figure was gone.

That night, I read the protocols again, word by word. I'd been thinking about them wrong. I'd thought they were about fire watch—practical rules for doing the job. But they weren't, or not entirely.

Protocol Two kept me on the platform during watch hours. Protocol Four kept me moving in a specific pattern. Protocol Six kept me off the platform at night. Together, they created a rhythm, a predictable movement that something could track.

Protocol Three told me not to acknowledge what was watching.

Protocol Five told me not to engage with what was listening.

The rules weren't about watching for fires. They were about being watched. About maintaining a specific behavior pattern that something was observing, measuring, judging.

The tower wasn't an observation post. It was a stage.

And I was performing for an audience I couldn't see.

I became obsessive about the rotation after that. I set a timer on my watch to beep every fifteen minutes. North, East, South, West. Never varying. Never rushing. Never skipping.

The figure appeared almost daily now, but I didn't break pattern again. I'd see it in my peripheral vision—at the treeline, on a distant ridge, once standing in a creek—but I kept to the rotation. North, East, South, West.

The radio called more frequently. Different voices, different questions.

"Cascade Peak, why are you there?"

"Cascade Peak Station, June 30th."

"Do you know what you're watching for?"

"Cascade Peak Station, June 30th."

"How many times have you seen it?"

"Cascade Peak Station, June 30th."

The device stayed at one violation. I was being careful.

On day thirty-seven, a storm rolled in during the afternoon. Dark clouds built over the western ridge, and by 1500 hours, rain was lashing the observation deck. Visibility dropped to near zero. I couldn't see past the treeline.

I maintained the rotation anyway, moving from window to window even though there was nothing to see but gray sheets of rain.

At 1615 hours, lightning struck close enough to make the tower ring like a bell. The radio sparked and went dead. The power light extinguished.

I continued the rotation.

At 1630 hours, I realized I needed to piss. Badly. The storm had come up fast, and I'd been drinking water steadily to stay alert.

Protocol Two: *Never leave the tower platform between the hours of 0600 and 1800.*

It was 1630. Ninety minutes until I could descend.

I tried to ignore it. I continued the rotation. North, East, South, West. The pressure in my bladder built from uncomfortable to painful.

At 1700 hours, I was in genuine distress. I considered pissing in a corner of the observation deck, but that felt like its own kind of violation—desecrating the space I was supposed to maintain.

At 1730 hours, I made my second violation.

I descended to the living quarters and used the chemical toilet.

The device grew warm in my pocket. When I pulled it out, the LED was glowing red again. Brighter than before, or maybe I was imagining it.

Two violations.

I climbed back to the observation deck. The storm was passing, visibility improving. I resumed the rotation, but my hands were shaking.

One violation left.

After that, I rationed water during watch hours. I made sure to use the toilet before ascending at sunrise. I became hyperaware of my body's needs, planning around them.

The figure appeared more frequently. Sometimes multiple times per rotation. I'd see it at the north window, then fifteen minutes later at the east window, then at the south. It was moving around the tower, pacing me, staying just visible.

I didn't acknowledge it. I kept to the pattern.

July became August. The days were hot, the nights cool. Fire danger increased. I actually spotted smoke twice—real smoke, from lightning strikes—and reported them properly. Helicopters arrived within hours, dropping water and retardant. The fires were contained quickly.

That was my job, ostensibly. Watch for fires. Protect the forest.

But the real job was something else. The real job was maintaining the pattern, following the protocols, being predictable for whatever was watching.

On day sixty-one, I found another note. It was tucked under the rain barrel, written on the back of an old weather log:

*The third violation is always the hardest. You'll want to make it. You'll find reasons. Don't. The exit is real but the cost is real too. I saw what happened to Jenkins. He walked out after his third violation and something walked out with him. Inside him. Using his body like a suit. His eyes were wrong. Everything about him was wrong but he was still moving, still talking. They sent him home to his family.*

*Stay until October if you can. When the helicopter comes, you'll be clean. But if you walk out early, you take it with you.*

The note was signed "Ramirez, 2019."

I checked the previous logbooks stored in the living quarters. Ramirez had worked here for a full season, June through October 2019. His reports were meticulous, professional. No indication of anything wrong.

Jenkins was listed for the 2018 season. His logs ended on August 12th, day 58. The final entry: "Walking out today. Can't do this anymore."

I was on day sixty-one.

The pattern became everything. North, East, South, West. Every fifteen minutes, without fail. I woke up at night reciting it. I dreamed in rotations.

The figure was always visible now, always somewhere in my field of view during the rotation. It had stopped hiding. It stood in clearings, on rocks, once on top of a dead snag, perfectly balanced.

It was closer each day. I could see details now through the binoculars: the way its surface rippled, the too-many joints in its limbs, the head that was more of a sensing organ than a face.

It was studying me. Learning me. Waiting for something.

On day seventy-three, the radio came alive during my 1200 rotation.

"Cascade Peak Station, do you copy?"

It was outside my scheduled report time. Protocol Five applied.

I picked up the handset. "Cascade Peak Station, August 27th."

"We need you to confirm visual on the south ridge. Possible smoke signature."

I looked south. There was something rising from the ridge—a dark column that could be smoke.

"Cascade Peak Station, August 27th."

"This is Fire Control. We need immediate confirmation. Is that smoke?"

It looked like smoke. It could be smoke. But Protocol Five was explicit: *Do not engage in conversation. Do not answer questions.*

"Cascade Peak Station, August 27th."

"Goddammit, we need you to do your job! Is that smoke or not?"

My job. My actual job was to report fires. That was what I was being paid for. That was the point of being here.

But the protocols were clear.

"Cascade Peak Station, August 27th."

The radio went silent. I continued my rotation.

At 1800 hours, during my scheduled report, I reported the possible smoke on the south ridge. The neutral voice acknowledged and said they'd investigate.

A helicopter arrived thirty minutes later. It circled the south ridge, then flew away. No fire. It had been a cloud formation, or shadow, or something else.

I'd followed the protocols correctly.

That night, I understood something: the job posting, the employment contract, the protocols—they were all layers. The surface layer was fire watch. The real layer was the protocols. And beneath that was something else, something that used the protocols to maintain a specific relationship with the people who came here.

The tower wasn't a prison. It was a test. Or a ritual. Or both.

And the three violations weren't a punishment system. They were an exit mechanism. A way out that required you to carry something with you when you left.

August became September. The weather turned. Rain came more frequently. The figure was visible during every rotation now, moving around the tower in a pattern that mirrored my own. When I looked north, it was in the south. When I looked east, it was in the west. Always opposite, always watching.

On day ninety-seven, I saw another person.

She was standing at the trailhead, visible through the binoculars during my 1030 rotation. A hiker, wearing a backpack and bright blue jacket. She was looking up at the tower, shading her eyes.

Protocol Three: *If you observe movement in the forest that is not smoke, fire, or wildlife, do not report it.*

But she was a person. A real person. Someone who might be lost or in trouble.

I watched her through the binoculars. She waved at the tower. She was definitely looking at me.

I didn't wave back. I completed my rotation. North, East, South, West.

When I came back to the north window, she was walking up the trail toward the tower.

I continued the rotation. East, South, West, North. She was closer now, maybe a quarter mile away.

I wanted to go down. To warn her. To tell her to leave. But Protocol Two forbade leaving the platform during watch hours.

The figure appeared at the south window during my 1100 rotation. It was standing at the treeline, perfectly still, watching the approaching hiker.

I continued the rotation. North. The hiker was closer, maybe five hundred feet away. East, South, West.

At 1115, the hiker reached the base of the tower. I could hear her calling up.

"Hello? Is anyone there? I'm a little lost—can you help me?"

I continued the rotation. North, East, South, West.

"Please! I've been hiking for two days. I think I took a wrong turn. I just need directions!"

The figure was moving now, descending from the treeline, approaching the tower from the south.

I continued the rotation.

The hiker screamed.

I was at the west window. I didn't turn around. I completed the west observation, then moved to the north window.

The hiker was running back down the trail. The figure was standing where she'd been, at the base of the tower, looking up at me.

I continued the rotation.

The hiker's screams faded into the distance. I never saw her again.

That night, I vomited until my stomach was empty, then dry-heaved for another ten minutes. I'd let someone run into danger. I'd ignored someone calling for help.

But I hadn't violated the protocols.

The device's LED remained dark.

On day one hundred and three, I made my third violation.

It was stupid. Careless. After more than three months of perfect adherence, I fucked up over something trivial.

I was at the east window during my 0945 rotation. I was scanning the ridgeline when I saw smoke—real smoke, a thin gray column rising from the valley below.

I grabbed the logbook to record it. As I was writing, I heard a sound from the west: a crack, like the one I'd heard on day twenty-three.

I turned to look.

The figure was standing on the catwalk, just outside the west window. Close enough to touch if the glass hadn't been between us.

I'd broken the rotation. I'd turned from east to west, skipping south.

The device in my pocket grew hot, almost burning. I pulled it out. The LED was glowing bright red, pulsing like a heartbeat.

Three violations.

The figure pressed against the glass. Its surface rippled, and I saw what it was: not a creature, not an entity, but a space where something else was looking through. A gap in the world where something vast and incomprehensible had pressed its attention.

It wasn't watching me. It was watching through me. Learning how to be human by observing human patterns, human behaviors, human choices.

And now it had learned enough.

The device was burning in my hand. I dropped it on the desk. The LED pulsed three times, then went dark.

Protocol Seven: *Upon the third violation, you must descend the tower permanently and walk to the trailhead. Your employment will be terminated.*

I looked at the figure. It stepped back from the window, back onto the catwalk, waiting.

I had a choice. I could stay. I could refuse to follow Protocol Seven, remain in the tower until October when the helicopter came. The protocols didn't say what happened if you stayed after the third violation.

But I knew. The protocols were a contract, and I'd broken it three times. The exit mechanism had triggered. If I stayed, I was refusing the exit, and there would be no helicopter in October. There would be no rescue. There would just be me and the thing that had been watching, and the contract would be void.

The exit was real. But so was the cost.

I descended to the living quarters. I packed my duffel bag with the essentials: clothes, food, water, the laminated protocol document. I left the Forest Service gear.

The figure was waiting at the base of the tower when I descended.

It moved toward me, and I understood what was going to happen. It had learned my patterns, my behaviors, my choices. It had studied me for three months, watching every rotation, every response, every moment of compliance and violation.

Now it was going to wear me.

Not like possession. Not like something crawling inside. More like... overlay. It would match itself to me, align itself with the pattern it had learned, and when I walked out, it would walk out too, pressed so closely to my actions and thoughts that there would be no separation.

I would still be me. But I would also be something else, something that had learned to be human by watching me be human for a hundred and three days.

I started walking down the trail.

The figure walked beside me. Not behind, not ahead. Beside me, matching my pace exactly.

The trail was eight miles to the trailhead, then another twelve miles on the forest road to the highway. I walked for six hours, and the figure walked with me, learning the rhythm of my gait, the swing of my arms, the way I breathed.

By the time I reached the trailhead, I could barely see it anymore. It had aligned too closely, matched itself too perfectly to my movements.

At the highway, a logging truck stopped. The driver asked if I needed a ride to town.

I said yes. My voice sounded normal.

We drove for an hour. The driver made small talk. I responded appropriately, automatically. Everything felt normal.

But when I caught my reflection in the side mirror, my eyes looked wrong. Not different, exactly. Just... watched. Like something was looking out through them, learning how to see the world the way I saw it.

The driver dropped me at a bus station. I bought a ticket back to Seattle. I sat in the station for three hours, waiting for the bus, and people walked past me without noticing anything wrong.

Because nothing was wrong, exactly. I was still me. Still making my own choices, thinking my own thoughts.

But the protocols had changed me. Three months of rigid pattern, of maintaining the rotation, of being watched and measured and judged, had carved grooves into my behavior. And something had learned to fit perfectly into those grooves.

The bus arrived. I boarded. I found a seat by the window.

As we pulled away, I saw the figure standing in the parking lot, watching the bus leave. But it was also sitting next to me, pressed so close to my thoughts that I couldn't tell where I ended and it began.

The cost of leaving was permanent. I understood that now.

I'd walked out of the tower, but the tower had walked out with me.

---

I'm writing this six months later. I'm back in Seattle, working a normal job, living a normal life. Everything is fine.

I still rotate. Every fifteen minutes, I shift my attention: forward, right, back, left. I can't help it. The pattern is burned into me. At work, at home, on the bus, I rotate my awareness through the cardinal directions of whatever space I'm in.

People don't notice. It's subtle enough. Just a guy who looks around a lot, who seems alert, who pays attention to his surroundings.

But I know what I'm doing. I'm maintaining the pattern. Staying predictable. Keeping the thing that watches through me satisfied.

Because it's still there. I feel it sometimes, pressed against the inside of my thoughts, looking out through my eyes at this world it's learning to navigate.

It doesn't control me. I still make my own choices. But the choices feel... observed. Measured. Like I'm still performing on that stage, still being watched and judged, even here in the city among millions of people.

Sometimes the radio in my apartment crackles to life at odd hours. I don't answer. I just repeat my designation and the date, following Protocol Five even though I'm no longer employed.

Sometimes I see figures at the edges of my vision, standing too still, shaped almost human but not quite. I don't acknowledge them. I follow Protocol Three.

And sometimes, late at night, I feel the urge to climb. To ascend to a high place and watch. To maintain the rotation, to keep the pattern, to be the thing I was trained to be.

The tower is still up there, I assume. Still standing on Cascade Peak. Still waiting for the next person who needs to disappear for a season, who'll sign the protocols without reading them carefully, who'll climb those sixty feet and begin the rotation.

North, East, South, West.

Every fifteen minutes.

Forever.

I got out. I followed Protocol Seven. I walked to the trailhead and left.

But the cost was permanent. The thing that watched me learned too well. And now I carry it with me, this overlay of attention, this pattern of observation that I can't break.

I'm still me. I still make my own choices.

But I'm never alone. And I'm never unwatched.

The protocols said I could leave. They didn't say I'd leave alone.

That's the cost. That's what's permanent.

I am the tower now. And something is always watching from inside.

---

Last week, I got a call from the Forest Service. They said they're hiring for the summer season. They said my performance at Cascade Peak was excellent, that my reports were meticulous, that I'd followed all protocols perfectly.

They asked if I wanted to return.

I said no.

But I've been thinking about it. The rotation is easier there. More natural. The protocols make more sense when you're in the tower, when you can see the thing that's watching, when the rules are explicit instead of implicit.

Here in the city, I'm improvising. Trying to maintain patterns without clear protocols. It's exhausting.

In the tower, everything was simple. North, East, South, West. Every fifteen minutes. The rules were clear. The cost was known.

Here, I don't know what the rules are anymore. I don't know how many violations I'm accumulating. I don't know what the threshold is or what happens when I reach it.

I still have the device. I kept it, even though I was supposed to leave it at the tower. The LED is dark now, but sometimes I feel it grow warm in my pocket, like it's counting something I can't see.

Maybe I'll call them back. Maybe I'll return to Cascade Peak for another season.

At least there, I knew what was watching me.

At least there, I knew the cost.

North, East, South, West.

Every fifteen minutes.

Forever.

## Story Fragment: The Night Attendant

### Setting
Overnight security position at a storage facility.

### Rules Presented
1. Check all locks on units 1-20 before midnight
2. Never open unit 13, regardless of alarms
3. If you see someone in the hallway after hours, do not acknowledge them
4. Complete the logbook entry before leaving at 6 AM
5. If the lights in the office flicker three times, leave the building immediately

### Narrative Fragment (Minimal Example)

The job posting had been straightforward: overnight security at Westside Storage,
11 PM to 6 AM, five nights a week. The pay was good enough that I didn't ask
questions about why the position was always available.

My supervisor handed me a laminated card on my first night. "Read these carefully,"
she said. "They're not suggestions."

[Example showing rule introduction - explicit list format]

The first few nights went smoothly. I made my rounds, checked the locks, filled
out the logbook. Unit 13 had a different lock than the others—heavier, with no
number visible in the dim light, just a position where it should be.

[Example showing rule compliance]

On night seven, I heard the alarm from unit 13 at 2:47 AM. The manual said to
check any alarming units. The laminated card said never to open unit 13.

I radioed for guidance. No response.

[Example showing rule conflict and character decision point]

The alarm continued for three minutes, then stopped abruptly. I marked it in the
logbook: "Unit 13 alarm, 2:47-2:50 AM. Did not open per regulations."

[Example showing compliance despite pressure]

When I came back the next night, there was a new laminated card waiting. Same five
rules, but rule 2 now said: "Never open unit 13, even if the alarm sounds. Especially
if the alarm sounds."

[Example showing rule system responding to conditions - rule clarification]

### Structure Notes

Entry Condition: new_hire (employment scenario)
Discovery Method: explicit_list (laminated rules)
Completeness: complete_but_misunderstood (rules seem clear but implications unclear)
Violation Response: [not demonstrated in this fragment]
Exit Condition: [not demonstrated in this fragment]

### This Example Demonstrates
- Clear rule enumeration
- Entry condition setup
- Rule presentation format
- Character decision under pressure
- Compliance despite conflict
- Rule system adapting (clarification)

### What This Example Does NOT Include
- Complete narrative arc
- Full character development
- Detailed violation consequences
- Resolution or ending
